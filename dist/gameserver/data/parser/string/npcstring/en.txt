1000001	A non-permitted target has been discovered.
1000002	Intruder removal system initiated.
1000003	Removing intruders.
1000004	A fatal error has occurred.
1000005	System is being shut down...
1000006	......
1000007	We shall see about that!
1000008	I will definitely repay this humiliation!
1000009	Retreat!
1000010	Tactical retreat!
1000011	Mass fleeing!
1000012	It's stronger than expected!
1000013	I'll kill you next time!
1000014	I'll definitely kill you next time!
1000015	Oh! How strong!
1000016	Invader!
1000017	There is no reason for you to kill me! I have nothing you need!
1000018	Someday you will pay!
1000019	I won't just stand still while you hit me.
1000020	Stop hitting!
1000021	It hurts to the bone!
1000022	Am I the neighborhood drum for beating!
1000023	Follow me if you want!
1000024	Surrender!
1000025	Oh, I'm dead!
1000026	I'll be back!
1000027	I'll give you ten million arena if you let me live!
1000028	$s1. Stop kidding yourself about your own powerlessness!
1000029	$s1, you will learn what the true fear is!
1000030	You're really stupid to have challenged me. $s1! Get ready!
1000031	$s1. Do you think that's going to work?!
1000032	I will definitely reclaim my honor which has been tarnished!
1000033	Show me the wrath of the knight whose honor has been downtrodden!
1000034	Death to the hypocrite!
1000035	I'll never sleep until I've shed my dishonor!
1000036	I'm here for the ones that are cursing the world!
1000037	I'll turn you into a malignant spirit!
1000038	I'll curse you with the power of revenge and hate!
1000039	For the glory of Gracia!
1000040	Do you dare pit your power against me?
1000041	I... I am defeated!!!
1000042	I am conveying the will of Nurka! Everybody get out of my way!
1000043	Those who stand against me shall die horribly!
1000044	Do you dare to block my way?!
1000045	My comrades will get revenge!
1000046	You heathen blasphemers of this holy place will be punished!
1000047	Step forward, you worthless creatures who challenge my authority!
1000048	My creator... The unchanging faithfulness to my master...
1000049	Master of the tower... My master... master... Where is he?
1000050	I AM THE ONE CARRYING OUT THE WILL OF CORE.
1000051	DESTROY THE INVADER.
1000052	STRANGE CONDITION - DOESN'T WORK
1000053	According to the command of Beleth... I'm going to observe you guys!
1000054	You people make me sick! No sense of loyalty whatsoever!
1000055	A challenge against me is the same as a challenge against Beleth...
1000056	Beleth is always watching over you guys!
1000057	That was really close! Antharas opened its eyes! 
1000058	You who disobey the will of Antharas! Die!
1000059	Antharas has taken my life!
1000060	I crossed back over the marshlands of death to reclaim the treasure!
1000061	Bring over and surrender your precious gold treasure to me!
1000062	I'll kill you in an instant!
1000063	No! The treasure is still..!
1000064	Invaders of Dragon Valley will never live to return!
1000065	I am the guardian that honors the command of Antharas to watch over this place!
1000066	You've set foot in Dragon Valley without permission! The penalty is death!
1000067	Antharas has taken my life!
1000068	The joy of killing! The ecstasy of looting! Hey guys, let's have a go at it again!
1000069	There really are still lots of folks in the world without fear! I'll teach you a lesson! 
1000070	If you hand over everything you've got, I'll at least spare your life!
1000071	Kneel down before one such as this!
1000072	Honor the master's wishes and punish all the invaders!
1000073	Honor the master's wishes and punish all the invaders!
1000074	Death is nothing more than a momentary rest...
1000075	Listen! This is the end of the human era! Antharas has awakened! 
1000076	Present the lives of four people to Antharas!
1000077	This is unbelievable! How could I have lost to one so inferior to myself?
1000078	I carry the power of darkness and have returned from the abyss.
1000079	It's detestable.
1000080	I finally find rest...
1000081	Glory to Orfen!
1000082	In the name of Orfen, I can never forgive you who are invading this place!
1000083	I'll make you pay the price for fearlessly entering Orfen's land!
1000084	Even if you disappear into nothingness, you will still face the life-long suffering of the curse that I have given you.
1000085	I'll stand against anyone that makes light of the sacred place of the Elves!
1000086	I will kill with my own hands anyone that defiles our home!
1000087	My brothers will never rest until we push you and your gang out of this valley!
1000088	Until the day of destruction of Hestui!
1000089	If any intrepid Orcs remain, attack them!
1000090	I'll break your windpipe!
1000091	Is revenge a failure?!
1000092	The sparkling mithril of the dwarves and their pretty treasures! I'll get them all!
1000093	Where are all the dreadful dwarves and their sparkling things?
1000094	Hand over your pretty treasures!
1000095	Hey! You should have run away!
1000096	DESTRUCTION - EXTINCTION - SLAUGHTER - COLLAPSE! DESTRUCTION - EXTINCTION - SLAUGHTER - COLLAPSE!
1000097	Destruction! Destruction! Destruction! Destruction!
1000098	Destruction! Destruction! Destruction. . .
1000099	Ta-da! Uthanka has returned!
1000100	Wah, ha, ha, ha! Uthanka has taken over this island today!
1000101	Whew! He's quite a guy!
1000102	How exasperating and unfair to have things happen in such a meaningless way like this...
1000103	This world should be filled with fear and sadness...
1000104	I won't forgive the world that cursed me!
1000105	I'll make everyone feel the same suffering as me!
1000106	I'll give you a curse that you'll never be able to remove forever!
1000107	I'll get revenge on you who slaughtered my compatriots!
1000108	Those who are afraid should get away and those who are brave should fight! 
1000109	I've got power from Beleth so do you think I'll be easily defeated?!
1000110	I am leaving now, but soon someone will come who will teach you all a lesson! 
1000111	Hey guys, let's make a round of our territory!
1000112	The rumor is that there are wild, uncivilized ruffians who have recently arrived in my territory.
1000113	Do you know who I am?! I am Sirocco! Everyone, attack!
1000114	What's just happened?! The invincible Sirocco was defeated by someone like you?!
1000115	Oh, I'm really hungry...
1000116	I smell food. Ooh... 
1000117	Ooh...
1000118	What does honey of this place taste like?!
1000119	Give me some sweet, delicious golden honey!
1000120	If you give me some honey, I'll at least spare your life...
1000121	Only for lack of honey did I lose to the likes of you.
1000122	Where is the traitor Kuroboros!?
1000123	Look in every nook and cranny around here!
1000124	Are you Lackey of Kuroboros?! I'll knock you out in one shot!
1000125	He just closed his eyes without disposing of the traitor... How unfair!
1000126	Hell for unbelievers in Kuroboros!
1000127	The person that does not believe in Kuroboros, his life will soon become hell!
1000128	The lackey of that demented devil, the servant of a false god! I'll send that fool straight to hell!
1000129	Uh... I'm not dying; I'm just disappearing for a moment... I'll resurrect again!
1000130	Hail to Kuroboros, the founder of our religion!
1000131	Only those who believe in Patriarch Kuroboros shall receive salvation!
1000132	Are you the ones that Sharuk has incited?! You also should trust in Kuroboros and be saved!
1000133	Kuroboros will punish you.
1000134	You who have beautiful spirits that shine brightly! I have returned!
1000135	You that are weary and exhausted... Entrust your souls to me.
1000136	The color of your soul is very attractive.
1000137	Those of you who live! Do you know how beautiful your souls are?!
1000138	It... will... kill... everyone...
1000139	I'm... so... lonely...
1000140	My... enemy...!
1000141	... Now... I'm not so lonely!
1000142	I will never forgive the Pixy Murika... that is trying to... kill us!
1000143	Attack all the dull and stupid followers of Murika!
1000144	I didn't have any idea about such ambitions!
1000145	This is not the end... It's just the beginning.
1000146	Hey... Shall we have some fun for the first time in a long while?...
1000147	There've been some things going around like crazy here recently...
1000148	Hey! Do you know who I am? I am Malex, Herald of Dagoniel! Attack!
1000149	What's just happened?! The invincible Malex just lost to the likes of you?!
1000150	It's something repeated in a vain life...
1000151	Shake in fear, all you who value your lives!
1000152	I'll make you feel suffering like a flame that is never extinguished!
1000153	Back to the dirt...
1000154	Hail Varika!!
1000155	Nobody can stop us!
1000156	You move slowly!
1000157	Varika! Go first!
1000158	Where am I? Who am I?
1000159	Uh... My head hurts like it's going to burst! Who am I?
1000160	You jerk. You're a devil! You're a devil to have made me like this!
1000161	Where am I? What happened? Thank you!
1000162	Ukru Master!
1000163	Are you Matu?
1000164	Marak! Tubarin! Sabaracha!
1000165	Pa'agrio Tama!
1000166	Accept the will of Icarus!
1000167	The people who are blocking my way will not be forgiven...
1000168	You are scum.
1000169	You lack power.

1000181	Sacred magical research is conducted here.
1000182	Behold the awesome power of magic!
1000183	Your powers are impressive but you must not annoy our high level sorcerer.
1000184	I am Barda, boss of the Bandit Stronghold!
1000185	I, Master Barda, once owned that stronghold,
1000186	Ah, very interesting!
1000187	You are more powerful than you appear. We'll meet again!
1000188	You filthy sorcerers disgust me!
1000189	Why would you build a tower in our territory?
1000190	Are you part of that evil gang of sorcerers?
1000191	That is why I don't bother with anyone below the level of sorcerer.
1000192	Ah, another beautiful day!
1000193	Our specialties are arson and looting.
1000194	You will leave empty-handed!
1000195	Ah, so you admire my treasure, do you? Try finding it! Ha! 
1000196	Is everybody listening? Sirion has come back. Everyone chant and bow...
1000197	Bow down, you worthless humans!
1000198	Very tacky!
1000199	Don't think that you are invincible just because you defeated me!
1000200	The material desires of mortals are ultimately meaningless.
1000201	Do not forget the reason the Tower of Insolence collapsed.
1000202	You humans are all alike, full of greed and avarice!
1000203	All for nothing,
1000204	What are all these people doing here?
1000205	I must find the secret of eternal life, here among these rotten angels!
1000206	Do you also seek the secret of immortality?
1000207	I shall never reveal my secrets!
1000208	Who dares enter this place?
1000209	This is no place for humans! You must leave immediately.
1000210	You poor creatures! Too stupid to realize your own ignorance!
1000211	You mustn't go there!
1000212	Who dares disturb this marsh?
1000213	The humans must not be allowed to destroy the marshland for their greedy purposes.
1000214	You are a brave man...
1000215	You idiots! Some day you shall also be gone!
1000216	Someone has entered the forest...
1000217	The forest is very quiet and peaceful.
1000218	Stay here in this wonderful forest!
1000219	My... my souls...
1000220	This forest is a dangerous place.
1000221	Unless you leave this forest immediately you are bound to run into serious trouble.
1000222	Leave now!
1000223	Why do you ignore my warning?
1000224	Harits of the world... I bring you peace!
1000225	Harits! Be courageous!
1000226	I shall eat your still-beating heart!.
1000227	Harits! Keep faith until the day I return... Never lose hope!
1000228	Even the giants are gone! There's nothing left to be afraid of now!
1000229	Have you heard of the giants? Their downfall was inevitable!
1000230	What nerve! Do you dare to challenge me?
1000231	You are as evil as the giants...
1000232	This dungeon is still in good condition!
1000233	This place is spectacular, wouldn't you say?
1000234	You are very brave warriors!
1000235	Are the giants truly gone for good?
1000236	These graves are good.
1000237	Gold and silver are meaningless to a dead man!
1000238	Why would those corrupt aristocrats bury such useful things?
1000239	You filthy pig! Eat and be merry now that you have shirked your responsibilities!
1000240	Those thugs! It would be too merciful to rip them apart and chew them up one at a time!
1000241	You accursed scoundrels!
1000242	Hmm, could this be the assassin sent by those idiots from Aden?
1000243	I shall curse your name with my last breath!
1000244	My beloved Lady Shillien...
1000245	I must break the seal and release Lady Shillien as soon as possible...
1000246	You shall taste the vengeance of Lady Shillien!
1000247	Lady Shillien... some day... I will accomplish... this mission...
1000248	Towards immortality...
1000249	He who desires immortality... Come unto me.
1000250	You shall be sacrificed to gain my immortality!
1000251	Eternal life in front of my eyes... I have collapsed in such a worthless way like this...
1000252	Zaken, you are a cowardly cur!
1000253	You are immortal, aren't you, Zaken?
1000254	Please return my body to me.
1000255	Finally... will I be able to rest?
1000256	What is all that racket?
1000257	Master Gildor does not like to be disturbed.
1000258	Please, just hold it down...
1000259	If you disturb Master Gildor I won't be able to help you.
1000260	Who dares approach?
1000261	These reeds are my territory...
1000262	You fools! Today you shall learn a lesson!
1000263	The past is past... Is it the beginning of a new era...?
1000264	This is the garden of Eva.
1000265	The garden of Eva is a sacred place.
1000266	Do you mean to insult Eva?
1000267	How rude! Eva's love is for all, even to ill-mannered louts like yourselves!
1000268	This place once belonged to Lady Shillien.
1000269	Leave this palace to us, spirits of Eva.
1000270	Why are you getting in our way?
1000271	Shillien... our Shillien!
1000272	All who fear of Fafurion... Leave this place at once!
1000273	You are being punished in the name of Fafurion!
1000274	Oh, master... please forgive your humble servant...
1000275	Prepare to die, foreign invaders! I am Gustav, the eternal ruler of this fortress and I have taken up my sword to repel thee!
1000276	Glory to Aden, the Kingdom of the Lion! Glory to Sir Gustav, our immortal lord!
1000277	Soldiers of Gustav, go forth and destroy the invaders!
1000278	This is unbelievable! Have I really been defeated? I shall return and take your head!
1000279	Could it be that I have reached my end? I cannot die without honor, without the permission of Sir Gustav!
1000280	Ah, the bitter taste of defeat... I fear my torments are not over...
1000281	I follow the will of Fafurion.

99707	Impressive, aren't I?

99715	Good luck!
99716	I'm all grown up now!
99717	If you let me go, I'll be your best friend.
99718	Fine! 
99719	Good job! Now what are you going to do?
99720	Keep it coming!
99721	That's what I'm talking about!
99722	May I have some more?
99723	That hit the spot!
99724	I feel special!
99725	I think it's working!
99726	You DO understand!
99727	Yuck! What is this? Ha Ha just kidding!
99728	A total of five and I'll be twice as alive!
99729	Nectar is sublime!
99730	You call that a hit?
99731	Why are you hitting me? Ouch, stop it! Give me nectar!
99732	Stop or I'll wilt!
99733	I'm not fully grown yet! Oh well, do what you will. I'll fade away without nectar anyway!
99734	Go ahead and hit me again. It won't do you any good! 
99735	Woe is me! I'm wilting! 
99736	I'm not fully grown yet! How about some nectar to ease my pain?
99737	The end is near!
99738	Pretty please... with sugar on top, give me some nectar!
99739	If I die without nectar, you'll get nothing.
99740	I'm feeling better! Another thirty seconds and I'll be out of here!
99741	Twenty seconds and it's ciao, baby!
99742	Woohoo, just ten seconds left! nine... eight... seven!
99743	Give me the nectar, or I'll be gone in 2 minutes!
99744	Give me the nectar, or I'll be gone in 1 minute!
99745	So long, losers!
99746	I'm out of here!
99747	I must be going! Have fun everybody!
99748	Time is up! Put your weapons down!
99749	Good for me, bad for you!
99750	Soundtastic!
99751	I can sing along if you like?
99752	I think you need some backup!
99753	Keep up that rhythm and you'll be a star!
99754	My heart yearns for more music.
99755	You're out of tune again!
99756	It’s so awful!
99757	I think I broke something!
99758	What a lovely melody! Play it again!
99759	Music to my, uh... ears!
99760	You need music lessons!
99761	I can't hear you!
99762	You can't hurt me like that!
99763	I'm stronger than you are!
99764	No music? I'm out of here!
99765	That racket is getting on my nerves! Tone it down a bit!
99766	You can only hurt me through music!
99767	Only musical instruments can hurt me! Nothing else!
99768	Your skills are impressive, but sadly, useless... 
99769	Catch a Chrono for me please.
99770	You got me!
99771	Now look at what you've done!
99772	You win!
99773	Fingers crossed!
99774	Don't tell anyone!
99775	Gross! My guts are coming out!
99776	Take it and go.
99777	I should've left when I could!
99778	Now look at what you've done!
99779	I feel dirty!
99780	Better luck next time!
99781	Nice shot!
99782	I'm not afraid of you!
99783	If I knew this was going to happen, I would have stayed home!
99784	Try harder or I'm out of here!
99785	I'm tougher than I look! 
99786	Good strike!
99787	Oh my gourd!
99788	That's all you've got?
99789	Why me?
99790	Bring me nectar!
99791	I must have nectar to grow!
99792	Give me some nectar quickly or you'll get nothing!
99793	Please give me some nectar! I'm hungry!
99794	Nectar please!
99795	Nectar will make me grow quickly!
99796	Don't you want a bigger Squash? Give me some Nectar and I'll grow much larger!
99797	If you raise me well, you'll get prizes! Or not...
99798	You are here for the stuff, eh? Well it's mine, all mine!
99799	Trust me, give me some Nectar and I'll become a giant Squash!

2114	What did you just do to me?
2005	Are you trying to tame me? Don't do that!
2006	Don't trust me. You will endanger yourself!
2007	Yuck! What is this? It tastes terrible! 
2008	I'm hungry. Give me a little more, please.
2009	What is this? Is it edible?
2010	Don't worry about me.
2011	Thank you. That was delicious!
2012	I think I am starting to like you!
2013	Eeeeek! Eeeeek!
2014	Don't keep trying to tame me. I don't want to be tamed.
2015	It is just food to me.  Although it may also be your hand.
2016	If I keep eating like this, won't I become fat? *chomp chomp*
2017	Why do you keep feeding me?
2018	Don't trust me. I'm afraid I may betray you later.
2019	Grrrrr....
2020	You brought this upon yourself...!
2021	I feel strange...!  I keep having these evil thoughts...!
2022	Alas... so this is how it all ends...
2023	I don't feel so good... Oh, my mind is very troubled...!
2024	$s1, so what do you think it is like to be tamed?
2025	$s1, whenever I see spice, I think I will miss your hand that used to feed it to me.
2026	$s1, I won't make it to the village. I don't have the strength to follow you.
2027	Thank you for trusting me, $s1. I hope I will be helpful to you.
2028	$s1, will I be able to help you?
2029	I guess it's just my animal magnetism.
2030	Too much spicy food makes me sweat like a beast.
2031	Animals need love too.
2032	What'd I miss? What'd I miss?
2033	I just know before this is over, I'm gonna need a lot of serious therapy.
2034	I sense great wisdom in you... I'm an animal, and I got instincts.
2035	Remember, I'm here to help.
2036	Are we there yet?
2037	That really made me feel good to see that.
2038	Oh, no, no, no, Nooooo!

2150	Who disturbs my sacred sleep?
2250	Did you call me, $s1?
2251	I'm confused! Maybe it's time to go back.
2550	That box was sealed by my master, $s1! Don't touch it!
2551	You've ended my immortal life! You're protected by the feudal lord, aren't you?
2450	That sign!
7050	You made it here, $s1. I'll show my strength. Die!
7051	Ha! You failed! Are you ready to quit?
7052	I'm the strongest! I lost everything to win!
7053	$s1! Are you doing this because they're Halisha's minions?
7054	My spirit is released from this shell. I'm getting close to Halisha...
7055	Mind your own business!
7056	This fight is a waste of time. Goodbye!
7057	Every cloud has a silver lining, don't you think?
7058	$s1! Don't listen to this demon.
7059	$s1! Hesitation betrays your heart. Fight!
7060	$s1! Isn't protecting somebody worthy? Isn't that justice?
7061	I have urgent business! I gotta go.
7062	Are my efforts in vain? Is this the end?
7063	Goodbye, friend. I hope to see you again.
7064	Knights are always foolish! 
7065	I'll show mercy on you for now.
7066	$s1! Your justice is just hypocrisy if you give up on what you've promised to protect.
7067	$s1...Don't think you've won! Your dark shadow will always follow you...hypocrite!
7150	A temple knight guards the Mother Tree! $s1! Has Human contact made you forget that?
7151	I must stop. Remember, the ones you're protecting will someday defeat the Elves.
7152	What! That will just strengthen the enemy!
7153	How dare you disturb the order of Swamplands! Die, $s1! 
7154	My spirit is released from this shell. I'm getting close to Halisha...
7155	Mind your own business!
7156	This is a waste of time. Goodbye!
7157	I'm not like my brother Panacea. Ghost of the past, begone!
7158	The Elves no longer rule! Help me, $s1!
7159	Don't give up, $s1! He' a demon from the past!
7160	Be proud, $s1. We protect this world together.
7161	I have to go. I've got some business to take care of.
7162	Ugh! Don't let him get away!
7163	Don't forget your pride. You're protecting the world!
7164	Ha, ha, ha!...
7165	Kuh, huh…
7166	Aah! Kuh...$s1!...Kuh, huh...
7167	$s1!...Re... mem... Ugh...Uh...
7250	$s1, You'd better listen.
7251	Huh? It's curtain time! I won't get any money.
7252	It can't be true!
7253	How dare you disturb the order of Swamplands! Die, $s1! 
7254	My spirit is released from this shell. I'm getting close to Halisha...
7255	Mind your own business!
7256	This is a waste of time. Goodbye!
7257	You won't get away this time, Narcissus!
7258	$s1! Help me!
7259	You must be aware of your audience when singing, $s1!
7260	You must work harder to be victorious, $s1.
7261	My song is over, I must go. Goodbye!
7262	How could I miss!
7263	Don't forget. Song comes with harmony.
7264	Sing. Everyone will listen.
7265	You don't deserve my blessing.
7266	Do you reject my blessing, $s1?
7267	But why, $s1. Everyone would praise you!
7350	$s1! Attack me? I'm immortal! I'm unrivaled!
7351	Ha! I'm immortal. This scar will soon heal. You'll die next time.
7352	Metellus! You promised me an immortal life! How could I, Swordmaster Iron, lose?
7353	How dare you disturb the order of Swamplands! Die, $s1! 
7354	My spirit is released from this shell. I'm getting close to Halisha...
7355	Mind your own business!
7356	This is a waste of time. Goodbye!
7357	Fallen Angel? It's worth trying.
7358	Hey $s1! Why don't you join? It's your best shot!
7359	Are you interested in immortal life, $s1? It's too boring for me.
7360	Excellent, $s1! Show me what you learned when your life was on the line!
7361	I have to go take a break.
7362	You missed?! What a fool you are!
7363	Fighting without risk, training without danger and growing without hardship will only lead to an inflated ego. Don't forget.
7364	Do you want an immortal life?
7365	Think it over. An immortal life and assured victory...
7366	That's good, $s1! Do you want my blessing to improve your skills?
7367	$s1! Why do you reject guaranteed victory?
7450	In the name of gods, I punish you, $s1! You can't rival us all, no matter how strong you think you are!
7451	I have to stop for now, but I'll defeat the power of the dragon yet!
7452	It is...The power that shouldn't live!
7453	How dare you disturb the order of Swamplands! Die, $s1! 
7454	My spirit is released from this shell. I'm getting close to Halisha...
7455	Mind your own business!
7456	This is a waste of time. Goodbye!
7457	Isn't it unwise for an angel to interfere in Human affairs?
7458	This is tough! $s1, would you help me?
7459	$s1! He's keeping an eye on all those in succession to the blood of dragons, including you!
7460	Attack the rear, $s1! If I'm killed, you're next!
7461	I can't stay any longer. There are too many eyes on us. Farewell!
7462	Get away? You're still alive. But...
7463	If we can't avoid this fight, we'll need great strength. It's the only way to peace.
7464	Warlord, you'll never learn the techniques of the dragon!
7465	Hey, why bother with this. Isn't it your mother's business?
7466	$s1! Are you against your mother's wishes? You're not worthy of the secrets of Shillien's children!
7467	Excellent technique, $s1. Unfortunately, you're the one destined for tragedy!
7550	$s1! You may follow me, but an Orc is no match for my giant's strength!
7551	Kuh...My body fails..This is the end! 
7552	How could I lose with the powers of a giant? Aargh!!!
7553	How dare you disturb the order of Swamplands! Die, $s1! 
7554	My spirit is released from this shell. I'm getting close to Halisha...
7555	Mind your own business!
7556	This is a waste of time. Goodbye!
7557	That's the enemy.
7558	Hmm.. $s1! Will you just stand there doing nothing?
7559	$s1. Nothing risked, nothing gained. Only those who fight enjoy the spoils of victory.
7560	A sword isn't jewelry, $s1. Don't you agree?
7561	With no fight, I have no reason to stay.
7562	Miss...
7563	Pick your battles wisely, or you'll regret it.
7564	What a fool to challenge the giant of the Oroka tribe!
7565	Running low on steam. I must withdraw.
7566	$s1. You're the one who defeated Guardian Muhark!
7567	$s1....! I must succeed...
7650	$s1... Would you fight Uruz, who has reached the power of Azira?
7651	I can't handle the power of Azira yet. First... 
7652	This can't be happening! I have the power of Azira! How could I fall so easily?
7653	How dare you disturb the order of Swamplands! Die, $s1! 
7654	My spirit is released from this shell. I'm getting close to Halisha...
7655	Mind your own business!
7656	This is a waste of time. Goodbye!
7657	Azira, born from the Evil Flame, I'll kill you with my bare hands!
7658	$s1! In the name of Khavatari Hubai, strike this evil with your fists!
7659	$s1! Attack from both sides! Hit hard!
7660	$s1! Strike with all your heart. It must work.
7661	Damn! It's time to go. Until next time.
7662	Evil Flame Spirit! I won't give up!
7663	My fist works even on the evil spirit. Don't forget!
7664	Foolish Khavatari...Do you think your power will work on me? I'm the source of your martial art!
7665	No more games...
7666	$s1...Are you next after Khavatari? Do you know who I am?
7667	$s1... Not bad. I can't hold on much longer.
7750	$s1, Akkan, you can't be my rival! I'll kill everything! I'll be the king!
7751	Ha! I'll show mercy on you this time. I know well of your technique!
7752	I have in me the blood of a king! How could I lose?!
7753	How dare you disturb the order of Swamplands! Die, $s1! 
7754	My spirit is released from this shell. I'm getting close to Halisha...
7755	Mind your own business!
7756	This is a waste of time. Goodbye!
7757	Are you....tyrant!
7758	You're not a king! You're just a tyrant! $s1, we must fight together!
7759	Such rule is ruining the country! $s1, I can't bear this tyranny any longer!
7760	$s1, leaders must always resist tyranny!
7761	I stayed too long. I'll be punished for being away so long.
7762	He got away, Dammit! We must catch this dark soul!
7763	What is a king? What must one do to be a good king? Think it over.
7764	Kneel down before me! Foolish people!
7765	It's time for the king to leave! Bow your head and say goodbye!
7766	$s1! You dare to fight me? A king's power must be great to rule!
7767	You would fight the king, $s1? Traitor!
7850	Tejakar Sharuhi! $s1, I'll show you the power of Sharuhi Mouth Mudaha!
7851	Aaargh! My soul won't keep quiet. Now I must take my leave.
7852	No, Sharuhi. You're soul is mine!
7853	How dare you disturb the order of Swamplands! Die, $s1! 
7854	My spirit is released from this shell. I'm getting close to Halisha...
7855	Mind your own business!
7856	This is a waste of time. Goodbye!
7857	Tejakar Oroca! Tejakar Duda-Mara!
7858	$s1, we must fight this soul together to prevent an everlasting winter!
7859	$s1! The soul responds to you. May your attack quiet him! 
7860	$s1! Calm Sharuhi! He doesn't listen to me anymore.
7861	It's time to go! May the eternal flame bless you!
7862	He left...That's too bad..Too bad...
7863	Don't forget your strong will now!
7864	Ha! Nobody will rule over me anymore! 
7865	Freedom... freedom... freedom!
7866	$s1, You released me, but you also want to catch me. Ha!
7867	...$s1...Me?....All right...I'll help you.
7950	Get out of here! This place is forbidden by god.
7951	Einhasad is calling me.
7952	You killed me! Aren't you afraid of god's curse?
7953	You bother my minions, $s1. Do you want to die?
7954	What the hell... I lost.
7955	Who are you? Why are you interfering in our business?
7956	You're strong. I'll get you next time!
7957	We meet again. I'll have you this time!
7958	A worthy opponent. $s1. Help me!
7959	$s1! Hurry before he gets away!
7960	I'll kill you!
7961	Why don't you fight me someday?
7962	I missed again. Dammit!
7963	I'm sure we'll meet again someday.
7964	Curse those who defy the gods!
7965	Einhasad is calling me.
7966	You would fight me, a messenger of the gods?
7967	I won't forget you, $s1!
8050	$s1! How could you desecrate a holy place?
8051	Leave before you are severely punished!
8052	Einhasad, don't give up on me!
8053	$s1, so you're the one who's looking for me?
8054	A mere mortal has defeated me!
8055	How cowardly to intrude in other people's business.
8056	Time is up.
8057	I'll kill you with my sword!
8058	Help me!
8059	Don't miss!
8060	Keep pushing!
8061	I'll get him. You'll have your revenge.
8062	I missed him again. I'll kill you.
8063	I must follow him.
8064	Curse those who defy the gods!
8065	Einhasad is calling me.
8066	You would fight me, a messenger of the gods?
8067	I won't forget you, $s1!
8150	$s1, you should leave if you fear god's wrath!
8151	What's going on?
8152	I'll see you again!
8153	Who are you? Why are you bothering my minions?
8154	No way!!!
8155	Why are you sticking your nose in our business?
8156	Who are you? How can a creature from the netherworld be so powerful?
8157	Is this the end?
8158	Show me what you're made of. Kill him!
8159	You think you can get him with that?
8160	Pull yourself together! He's trying to get away.
8161	Tell the Black Cat that I got his paid back.
8162	Black Cat, he'll blame me.
8163	I gotta' go now.
8164	Curse those who defy the gods!
8165	Einhasad is calling me.
8166	I'll kill you in the name of god.
8167	$s1! See you later.
8250	$s1! How could you desecrate a holy place?
8251	Get out before you're punished!
8252	Einhasad, please don't give up on me!
8253	$s1, are you looking for me?
8254	A mere mortal is killing me!
8255	Mind your own business!
8256	Mortal, don't you recognize my greatness?

8552	Tanakia! Forgive me. I couldn't fulfill your dream!
8553	Are you the one who's been bothering my minions, $s1? 
8554	Damn! I can't believe I've been beaten by you. 
8555	Who are you? This isn't your business, coward.
8556	How weak. I'll forgive you this time because you made me laugh. 
8557	You're stronger than I thought, but I'm no weakling either!

8559	$s1! Pull yourself together!
8560	$s1! We won't beat him unless we give it our all. Come on!
8561	I'll follow him.

9152	How could it happen? Defeated by a Human!
9153	How dare you disturb the order of Swamplands! Die, $s1! 
9154	My spirit is released from this shell. I'm getting close to Halisha...
9155	Mind your own business!
9156	This is a waste of time. Goodbye!
9157	My master sent me here! I'll give you a hand.
9158	Meow~! Master $s1, help me!

9257	I came to help you. It's the will of Radyss.
9258	$s1! Fight with me!
9259	$s1! We must defeat him!
9260	$s1. There's no time. We must defeat him!
9261	Radyss is calling me. I gotta' go now.
9262	I was unable to avenge my brother.
9263	May you be blessed.
9264	The proud, repent! The foolish, awaken! Sinners, die!
9265	Hell's master is calling. Atonement will have to wait!
9266	$s1, I'll remember your name, heathen. 
9267	I won't forget the name of one who doesn't obey holy judgment, $s1!
9350	You carouse with evil spirits, $s1! You're not worthy of the holy wisdom!
9351	You're stubborn as a mule! I guess I can't boss you around any more!
9352	Could it be...? Defeated by a Dark Elf!
9353	How dare you disturb the order of Swamplands! Die, $s1! 
9354	My spirit is released from this shell. I'm getting close to Halisha...
9355	Mind your own business!
9356	This is a waste of time. Goodbye!
9357	Shadow Summoner, I came here to help you.
9358	Shadow Summoner, $s1! Fight with me!
9359	$s1, You'll die if you don't kill him!
9360	Hurry, $s1! Don't miss him!
9361	I can't hold on any longer...
9362	After all that...I missed him...
9363	Shadow summoner! May you be blessed!
9364	My master sent me here to kill you!
9365	The shadow is calling me...
9366	$s1, you want to die early? I'll send you to the darkness!
9367	You deal in darkness, $s1! I'll pay you back.
9450	You're $s1? I won't be like Hindemith!
9451	You're feistier than I thought! I'll stop here for today.
9452	Aargh! I can't believe I lost...
9453	Are you the one who's been bothering my minions, $s1?
9454	Yikes! You're tough!
9455	Mind your own business!
9456	I'll stop here for today.
9457	I can't let you commune with Tablet of Vision! Give me the Resonance Amulet!
9458	Dammit! This is too hard by myself... $s1! Give me a hand! 
9459	$s1! Hurry or we'll miss him.
9460	$s1! Hurry up!
9461	I must follow him.
9462	Are you running away? Stop!
9463	See you next time~
9464	Are you betraying me? I thought something was wrong...I'll stop here.
9465	I gotta' go now.
9466	You're $s1? Even two of you can't stop me!
9467	Dammit! My Resonance Amulet...$s1, I'll never forget to pay you back.
9550	Are you... $s1? I won't be like Waldstein!
9551	You're feistier than I thought! I'll stop here for today.
9552	Yikes! I can't believe I lost...
9553	Are you the one bothering my minions, $s1?
9554	Yikes! You're tough!
9555	Mind your own business!
9556	I'll stop here for today.
9557	I can't let you commune with Tablet of Vision! Give me the Resonance Amulet!
9558	Dammit! This is too hard by myself... $s1! Give me a hand! 
9559	$s1! Hurry or we'll miss him.
9560	$s1! Please hurry!
9561	I must follow him.
9562	Are you running away? Stop!
9563	See you next time~
9564	Are you betraying me? I thought something was wrong...I'll stop here.
9565	I gotta go now...
9566	You're... $s1? Even two of you can't stop me!
9567	Dammit! My Resonance Amulet...$s1, I'll never forget this.
9650	You're $s1? I'll kill you for Hallate! 
9651	You're tougher than I thought, but you still can't rival me!
9652	Hallate! Forgive me! I can't help you.
9653	Are you the one who's been bothering my minions, $s1? 
9654	Damn! I can't believe I've been beaten by you. 
9655	Who are you? Mind your own business, coward.
9656	How weak. I'll forgive you this time because you made me laugh. 
9657	Purgatory Lord, I won't fail this time. 
9658	$s1! Now's the time to put your training to the test!
9659	$s1! Your sword skills can't be that bad.
9660	$s1! Show your strength!
9661	I have some pressing business. I have to go.
9662	I missed him! Dammit.
9663	Try again sometime. 
9664	I'll kill anyone who gets in my way!
9665	This is pathetic! You make me laugh. 
9666	$s1! How dare you stand in my way!
9667	$s1! When I come back, I'll kill you. 
9750	$s1? Wake up! Time to die! 
9751	You're tougher than I thought! I'll be back!
9752	I lost? It can't be!
9753	Are you the one who's been bothering my minions, $s1? 
9754	Damn! I can't believe I've been beaten by you. 
9755	Who are you? Mind your own business, coward.
9756	How weak. I'll forgive you this time because you made me laugh. 
9757	You're a cunning fiend. I won't fail again. 
9758	$s1! It's after you! Fight!
9759	$s1! You have to fight better than that if you expect to survive!
9760	$s1! Pull yourself together! Fight!
9761	I'll catch the cunning fiend. 
9762	I missed him again! He's clever!
9763	Don't cower like a puppy next time!
9764	I have only one goal. Get out of my way. 
9765	Just wait. You'll get yours! 
9766	$s1! You're a coward, aren't you!
9767	$s1! I'll kill you next time. 
9850	$s1! How foolish to act against the will of god.
9851	Your faith is stronger than I thought. I'll get you next time.
9852	Tanakia, forgive me! I couldn't fulfill your dream!
9853	Are you the one who's been bothering my minions, $s1? 
9854	Damn! I can't believe I've been beaten by you. 
9855	Who are you? Mind your own business, you coward!
9856	How weak. I'll forgive you this time because you made me laugh. 
9857	Tanakia, your lie has already been exposed! 
9858	$s1! Help me overcome this. 
9859	$s1! We can't defeat Tanakia this way.
9860	$s1! Here's our chance. Don't squander the opportunity!
9861	Goodbye. We'll meet again if fate allows. 
9862	I'll follow Tanakia to correct this falsehood. 
9863	I'll be back if fate allows. 
9864	For Shillien!
9865	I'll be back. You'll pay.
9866	$s1! Are you trying to spoil my plan?
9867	$s1! I'll pay you back. I won't forget you. 
9950	$s1, You have an affinity for dangerous ideas. Are you ready to die?
9951	My time is up...
9952	I can't believe I must kneel to a Human!
9953	How dare you disturb the order of Swamplands! Die, $s1! 
9954	My spirit is released from this shell. I'm getting close to Halisha...
9955	Mind your own business!
9956	This is a waste of time. Goodbye!
9957	Minervia! What's the matter?
9958	The princess is in danger. Why are you staring?
9959	Master $s1! Come on, Hurry up!
9960	We can't fail! Master $s1, Pull yourself together!
9961	What am I doing... I gotta' go! Goodbye.
9962	Dammit! I missed...!
9963	Sorry, but I must say goodbye again... Good luck to you!
9964	I can't yield the secret of the tablet!
9965	I'll stop here for now...
9966	$s1, you dared to leave scar on my face! I'll kill you!!!
9967	$s1, I won't forget your name...Ha!
10050	$s1? You have an affinity for bad ideas. Are you ready to die?
10051	My time is up...
10052	I can't believe I must kneel to a Human!
10053	How dare you disturb the order of Swamplands! Die, $s1! 
10054	My spirit is released from this shell. I'm getting close to Halisha...
10055	Mind your own business!
10056	This is a waste of time. Goodbye!
10057	You thief! Give me the Resonance Amulet! 
10058	Ugh! $s1, Help me!
10059	$s1. Please, help me! Together we can beat him. 
10060	$s1! Are you going to let a guild member die?
10061	I'm sorry, but I gotta' go first!
10062	Aaaah! I couldn't get the Resonance Amulet.
10063	Take care! I gotta' go now~!
10064	I'm sorry, but it's my job to kill you now!
10065	What a waste of time!
10066	$s1! How could you do this? I'll kill you!
10067	$s1! I'll pay you back!
10068	Why don't you just die?!
10069	Taste the sting of Level 5 Spoil!
10070	The item is already inside you...
10071	This potion you're making me drink is worth its weight in gold!
10072	This potion is prepared from the ground gall of a bear. Be careful - it packs quite a punch!
10073	How can you use a potion on a newbie...
10074	Listen to me, $s1! Unless you have prior authorization, you can't carry a weapon here!
10075	Dear $s1, may the blessings of Einhasad be with you always.
10076	Dear brother $s1, follow the path of light with me...
10077	$s1, why would you choose the path of darkness?!
10078	$s1! How dare you defy the will of Einhasad!
10079	The door to the 3rd floor of the altar is now open.
33420	I will make your love come true~ love, love, love~
33421	I have wisdom in me. I am the box of wisdom!
33422	Oh, oh, oh!
33423	Do you want us to love you? Oh.
33424	Who is calling the Lord of Darkness!
33425	I am a great empire, Bonaparterius!
33426	Let your head down before the Lord!

11550	This looks like the right place... 
11551	I see someone. Is this fate?
11552	We meet again. 
11553	Don't bother trying to find out more about me. Follow your own destiny. 
11450	You, $s1, you attacked Wendy. Prepare to die!
11451	$s1, your enemy was driven out. I will now withdraw and await your next command.
11452	This enemy is far too powerful for me to fight. I must withdraw.
11453	The radio signal detector is responding. # A suspicious pile of stones catches your eye.
50851	You've successfully completed a clan quest. $s1 points have been added to your clan's reputation score.
41651	My dear friend of $s1, who has gone on ahead of me!
41652	Listen to Tejakar Gandi, young Oroka! The spirit of the slain leopard is calling you, $s1!
1010623	Who dares to covet the throne of our castle! Leave immediately, or you will pay the price of your audacity with your very own blood!
1010624	Hmm, those who are not of the bloodline are coming this way to take over the castle?! Humph! The bitter grudges of the dead. You must not make light of their power!
1010625	Aargh... If I die, then the magic force field of blood will...
1010626	It's not over yet... It won't be... over... like this... Never...
1010627	Oooh! Who poured nectar on my head while I was sleeping?
1010628	Please wait a moment.
1010629	The word you need this time is $s1.
1010630	Intruders! Sound the alarm!
1010631	De-activate the alarm.
1010632	Oh no! The defenses have failed. It is too dangerous to remain inside the castle. Flee! Every man for himself!
1010633	The game has begun. Participants, prepare to learn an important word.
1010634	The $s1 team's jackpot has $s2%% of its remaining HP.
1010635	Undecided
1010636	Heh Heh... I see that the feast has begun! Be wary! The curse of the Hellmann family has poisoned this land!
1010637	Arise, my faithful servants! You, my people who have inherited the blood. It is the calling of my daughter. The feast of blood will now begin!
1010638	You may have lordship over the forest for now…but remember! The true lord will return… Enjoy your power while it lasts, if you can manage to sleep at night! Hahaha!
1010639	In 2 min. the game arena will be cleaned. Throw any items you don't need on the floor.
1010640	Grarr! $s1 team is using the Hot Spring Brimstone on the opponent's camp.
1010641	Grarr! $s1 team is attempting to steal the jackpot.
1010642	** Vacant Seat **
1010643	Time left: $s1 min.
1010644	How dare you ruin the performance of the Dark Choir... Unforgivable!
1010645	Get rid of the invaders who interrupt the performance of the Dark Choir!
1010646	Don't you hear the music of death? Reveal the horror of the Dark Choir!

1800014	Oink oink! Pigs can do it too! Antharas-Surpassing Super Powered Pig Stun! How do like them apples?
1800015	Oink oink! Take that! Valakas-Terrorizing Ultra Pig Fear! Ha ha!
1800016	Oink oink! Go away! Stop bothering me!
1800017	Oink oink! Pigs of the world unite! Let's show them our strength!
1800018	You healed me. Thanks a lot! Oink oink!
1800019	Oink oink! This treatment hurts too much! Are you sure that you're trying to heal me?
1800020	Oink oink! Transform with Moon Crystal Prism Power!
1800021	Oink oink! Nooo! I don't want to go back to normal!
1800022	Oink oink! I'm rich, so I've got plenty to share! Thanks!
1800023	It's a weapon surrounded by an ominous aura. I'll discard it because it may be dangerous. Miss...!
1800024	Thank you for saving me from the clutches of evil!
1800025	That is it for today...let's retreat. Everyone pull back!
1800026	Thank you for the rescue. It's a small gift.
1800027	$s1... You don't have a Red Crystal...
1800028	$s1.. You don't have a Blue Crystal...
1800029	$s1.. You don't have a Clear Crystal...
1800030	$s1.. If you are too far away from me...I can't let you go...
1800031	An alarm has been set off! Everybody will be in danger if they are not taken care of immediately!
1800032	It will not be that easy to kill me!
1800033	No...You knew my weakness...
1800034	Hello? Is anyone there?
1800035	Is no one there? How long have I been hiding? I have been starving for days and cannot hold out anymore!
1800036	If someone would give me some of those tasty Crystal Fragments, I would gladly tell them where Tears is hiding! Yummy, yummy!
1800037	Hey! You from above the ground! Let's share some Crystal Fragments, if you have any.
1800038	Crispy and cold feeling! Teehee! Delicious!!
1800039	Yummy! This is so tasty.
1800040	Sniff, sniff! Give me more Crystal Fragments!
1800041	How insensitive! It's not nice to give me just a piece! Can't you give me more?
1800042	Ah - I'm hungry!
1800043	I'm the real one!
1800044	Pick me!
1800045	Trust me!
1800046	Not that dude, I'm the real one!
1800047	Don't be fooled! Don't be fooled! I'm the real one!!
1800048	Just act like the real one! Oops!
1800049	You've been fooled!
1800050	Sorry, but...I'm the fake one.
1800051	I'm the real one! Phew!!
1800052	Can't you even find out?

1800167	C-grade
1800168	D-grade
1800169	F-grade
1800170	This is... This is a great achievement that is worthy of the true heroes of legend!
1800171	Admirable. You greatly decreased the speed of invasion through Kamaloka.
1800172	Very good. Your skill makes you a model for other adventurers to follow.
1800173	Good work. If all adventurers produce results like you, we will slowly start to see the glimmer of hope.
1800174	Unfortunately, it seems that Rim Kamaloka cannot be easily approached by everyone.
1800175	How disappointing. It looks like I made a mistake in sending you inside Rim Kamaloka.
1800176	Intruder alert. Intruder alert.
1800177	What are you doing? Hurry up and help me!
1800178	I've had it up to here with you! I'll take care of you!
1800179	Ah... My mind is a wreck.
1800180	If you thought that my subordinates would be so few, you are mistaken!
1800181	There's not much I can do, but I want to help you.
1800182	 $s1! Go get him!!
1800183	Come out! My subordinate! I summon you to drive them out!
1800184	There's not much I can do, but I will risk my life to help you!
1800185	Arg! The pain is more than I can stand!
1800186	Ahh! How did he find my weakness?
1800187	We were able to successfully collect the Essence of Kamaloka from the Kanabions that you defeated. Here they are.
1800188	But we were able to collect somehow the Essence of Kamaloka from the Kanabions that you defeated. Here they are.
1800189	I'm sorry, but we were unable to collect the Essence of Kamaloka from the Kanabions that you defeated because their dark energy was too weak.
1800190	Rather than simply defeating the enemies, you seem to understand our goal and purpose as well.
1800191	Dopplers and Voids possess an enhanced amount of the Kanabions' dark energy, so it is important to concentrate on defeating them when blocking the Kamalokians attack.
1800192	Have you seen Kanabions being remade as new Kanabions sometimes? You can see it occur more often by inflicting great damage during an attack or at the moment you defeat them.
1800193	As in any other battle, it is critical to protect yourself while you are inside Rim Kamaloka. We do not want to attack recklessly.
1800194	We value developing an individual's overall power rather than a one-time victory. If you relied on another person's support this time, why don't you try to rely on your own strength next time?
1800195	Are you sure that the battle just now was at the appropriate level? Bothering lower Kanabions, as if for mere entertainment, is considered to be a wasted battle for us.
1800196	The greatest victory involves using all available resources, eliminating all of the enemy's opportunities, and bringing it to the fastest possible end. Don't you think so?
1800197	Emergency! Emergency! The outer wall is weakening rapidly!
1800198	The remaining strength of the outer wall is $s1!
1800199	Pathfinder Savior
1800200	Pathfinder Supporter
1800201	Some Kanabions who haven't fully adjusted yet to their new physical form are known to exhibit symptoms of an extremely weakened body structure sometimes. If you attack them at that moment, you will have great results.
1800202	Have you ever heard of $s1? They say it's a genuine $s2!

1800227	Be careful...! Something's coming...!
1800228	You must first found a clan or belong to one.

1800231	Ekimus has been weakened by losing strength from a tumor!
1800232	The Soul Coffin has awakened Ekimus. If $s1 more Soul Coffin(s) are created, the defense of the Heart of Infinity will fail...
1800233	C'mon, c'mon! Show your face, you little rats! Let me see what the doomed weaklings are scheming!
1800234	Impressive.... Hahaha it's so much fun, but I need to chill a little while.  Argekunte, clear the way!
1800235	Kyahaha! Since the tumor has been resurrected, I no longer need to waste my time on you!
1800236	Keu... I will leave for now... But don't think this is over... The Seed of Infinity can never die...
1800237	Kahahaha! That guy's nothing! He can't even kill without my permission! See here! Ultimate forgotten magic! Deathless Guardian!
1800238	I curse the day that I became your slave in order to escape death, Cohemenes! I swear that I shall see you die with my own eyes!
1800239	My enemy is dying, and my blood is boiling! What cruel curse is this!

1800247	$s1's party has moved to a different location through the crack in the tumor!
1800248	$s1's party has entered the Chamber of Ekimus through the crack in the tumor!
1800249	Ekimus has sensed abnormal activity. \nThe advancing party is forcefully expelled!
1800250	There aren't enough items. In order to summon the airship, you need 5 Energy Star Stones.
1800251	The Soul Devourers who are greedy to eat the Seeds of Life that remain alive until the end have awakened...!
1800252	The first Feral Hound of the Netherworld has awakened!
1800253	The second Feral Hound of the Netherworld has awakened!
1800254	Clinging on won't help you! Ultimate forgotten magic, Blade Turn!
1800255	Even special sauce can't help you! Ultimate forgotten magic, Force Shield!
1800256	You little doomed maggots! Even if you keep swarming, the power of Immortality will only grow stronger!
1800257	The Airship Summon License has been awarded. Your clan can now summon an airship.
1800258	The Gracia treasure chest has appeared!
1800259	The Gracia treasure chest will soon disappear!
1800260	You have been cursed by the tumor and have incurred $s1 damage.
1800261	I shall accept your challenge, $s1! Come and die in the arms of immortality!
1800262	You will participate in $s1 $s2 shortly. Be prepared for anything.
1800263	You can hear the undead of Ekimus rushing toward you. $s1 $s2, it has now begun!
1800264	You can feel the surging energy of death from the tumor.
1800265	The area near the tumor is full of ominous energy.
1800266	You tried to drop us. How stupid!
1800267	We are blood brethren. I can't fall so easily here and leave my brother behind.
1800268	You were always what I aspired to be. Do you think I would fall so easily here when I have a brother like that?
1800269	With all connections to the tumor severed, Ekimus has lost its power to control the Feral Hound!
1800270	With the connection to the tumor restored, Ekimus has regained control over the Feral Hound...
1800271	Woooong!
1800272	Woong... Woong... Woo...
1800273	The enemies have attacked. Everyone come out and fight!!!! ... Urgh~!
1800274	The tumor inside $s1 has been destroyed! \nIn order to draw out the cowardly Cohemenes, you must destroy all the tumors!
1800275	The tumor inside $s1 has completely revived. \nThe restrengthened Cohemenes has fled deeper inside the seed...
1800276	The awarded Airship Summon License has been received.
1800277	You do not currently have an Airship Summon License. You can earn your Airship Summon License through Engineer Lekon.
1800278	The Airship Summon License has already been awarded.
1800279	If you have items, please give them to me.
1800280	My stomach is empty.
1800281	I'm hungry, I'm hungry!
1800282	I'm still not full...
1800283	I'm still hungry~
1800284	I feel a little woozy...
1800285	Give me something to eat.
1800286	Now it's time to eat~
1800287	I also need dessert.
1800288	I'm still hungry.

1800305	The tumor inside $s1 has completely revived. \nEkimus started to regain his energy and is desperately looking for his prey...
1800306	Bring more, more souls...!
1800307	The Hall of Erosion attack will fail unless you make a quick attack against the tumor!
1800308	As the tumor was not threatened, Cohemenes completely ran away to deep inside the Seed...

1800715	It's under occupation by our forces, but the enemy has already overtaken the Hall of Erosion and is driving out our forces from the Hall of Suffering toward the Heart. It seems that Ekimus will revive shortly.
1800716	
1800717	Tiat's followers are coming to retake the Seed of Destruction! Get ready to stop the enemies!
1800718	It's hurting... I'm in pain... What can I do for the pain...
1800719	No... When I lose that one... I'll be in more pain...
1800720	Hahahah!!! I captured Santa!! There will be no gifts this year!!!
1800721	Now! Why don't you take up the challenge?
1800722	Come on, I'll take all of you on! 
1800723	How about it? I think I won?
1800724	Now!! Those of you who lost, go away!
1800725	What a bunch of losers.
1800726	I guess you came to rescue Santa. But you picked the wrong person.
1800727	Wow!
1800728	Agh!! I wasn't going to do that!
1800729	You're cursed!! Oh.. What?
1800730	Have you done nothing but rock-paper-scissors?! 
1800731	Stop it, no more... I did it because I was too lonely...
1800732	I have to release Santa... How infuriating!!!
1800733	I hate happy Happy Holidays!!! 
1800734	Oh. I'm bored.
1800735	Shall I go to take a look if Santa is still there? Hehe
1800736	Ho ho ho! Happy Holidays! 
1800737	Santa could give nice presents only if he's released from the Turkey...
1800738	Oh ho ho! Thank you! I will reward you for sure.
1800739	Happy Holidays~ Well done. 
1800740	Happy Holidays~ Thank you for rescuing me from that wretched Turkey.

1800742	I have a gift for $s1.
1800743	Take a look at the inventory. I hope you like the gift I gave you. 
1800744	Take a look at the inventory. Perhaps there might be a big present~
1800745	I'm tired of dealing with you. I'm leaving.
1800746	When are you going to stop? I slowly started to be tired of it.
1800747	Message from Santa: Many blessings to $s1, who saved me~
1800748	I am already dead. You cannot kill me again...
1800749	Oh followers of the Dragon of Darkness, fight by my side!
1800750	The Dragon Race... are invading... Prepare... for battle...
1800751	$s1 rescued Santa of $s2 territory from the turkey.
1800752	Santa Rescue Success!
1800753	$s1 received +$s2 $s3 through the weapon coupon.
1800754	Don't go prattling on!
1800755	You lowlifes with not even an ounce of pride! You're not worthy of opposing me!
1800756	Roar~! No~ Oink oink~! See~! I'm a pig~! Oink oink~!!

1800816	Hey~. Are you planning on eating me?! Use a Cupid's Energy Potion already!
1800817	I'll pass on an amateur's meridian massage. Use a Cupid's Energy Potion already!
1800818	I already feel more energetic. Thanks, $s1 -
1800819	How refreshing! You wouldn't happen to be a master masseuse, $s1, would you?
1800820	Incredible. From now on, I'll compare all massages to this one with $s1!
1800821	Isn't it tough doing it all on your own? Next time, try making a party with some comrades~
1800822	Sorry, but I'll leave my friend in your care as well~ Thanks.
1800823	Sniff sniff~ Do you smell the scent of a fresh-baked baguette?
1800824	Who am I~? Let me know if you wanna buy my bread~~

1800826	What? You don't like it? What's the matter with you~ Like an amateur!
1800827	Hey~ Did you tell a lie on April Fool's Day? Don't talk to me if you didn't~!

1800832	Wait... Wait! Stop! Save me, and I'll give you 10,000,000 Adena!!
1800833	I... don't want to fight...
1800834	Is this really necessary...?
1800835	Th... Thanks... I could have become good friends with you...
1800836	I'll give you 10,000,000 Adena, like I promised! I might be an orc who keeps my promises!
1800837	Thanks, but that thing about 10,000,000 Adena was a lie! See ya!!
1800838	You're pretty dumb to believe me!
1800839	A curse upon you!
1800840	I really... didn't want... to fight...
1800841	All 4 of Kasha's Eyes have appeared! 
1800842	Kasha's Eye emanates a foreboding curse.
1800843	Defeat Kasha's Eye to put a stop to the foreboding curse!
1800844	I protect the altar! You can't escape the altar!
1800845	$s1! That stranger must be defeated. Here is the ultimate help!
1800846	Look here!! $s1. Don't fall too far behind.

1800876	Are you the one who was looking for me?
1800877	You've obtained $s1 Lv. $s2.
1800878	You've found your death, fools!
1800879	When inventory weight/number are more than 80%%, the Life Stone from the Beginning cannot be acquired.
1800880	You are under my thumb!!
1800881	Time of adventure in this instance zone is extended for 20 min.
1800882	Hurry!
1800883	I am not that type of person who stays in one place for a long time
1800884	It's hard for me to keep standing like this
1800885	Why don't I go that way this time
1800886	Welcome!
1800887	Is that it? Is that the extent of your abilities? Put in a little more effort!!
1800888	Your abilities are pitiful... You are far from a worthy opponent.
1800889	Even after death you order me to wander around looking for the scapegoats!
1800890	Here goes the Heatstroke! If you can withstand the hot heatstroke up to the 3rd stage, the Sultriness will come to you.
1800891	Just you wait! Humidity is a blistering fireball which can easily withstand plenty of Cool Air Cannon attacks!
1800892	In order to defeat Humidity, you must obtain the Heatstroke Prevention Effect from Doctor Ice and fire more than 10 rounds of the Cool Air Cannon on it!
1800893	You are here, $s1! I'll teach you a lesson! Bring it on!
1800894	That's cold! Isn't it one of those Cool Packs? I hate anything that's cold!
1800895	Huh! You've missed! Is that all you have?
1800896	I will give you precious things that I have stolen. So stop bothering me!
1800897	I was going to give you a jackpot item. You don't have enough inventory room. See you next time.
1800898	$s1 defeated the Sultriness and acquired item S84
1800899	$s1 defeated the Sultriness and acquired item S80
1800900	I am not here for you! Your Cool Pack attack does not work against me!
1800901	Uh oh? Where are you hiding? There is nobody who matches my skills? Well, I guess I'd better get going....
1800902	Why are you not responding? You don't even have any Cool Packs! You can't fight me!
1800903	Oh~! Where I be~? Who call me~?
1800904	Tada~! It's a watermelon~!
1800905	>_<... Did ya call me...?
1800906	Enter the watermelon~! It's gonna grow and grow from now on!
1800907	Oh, ouch~! Did I see you before~?
1800908	A new season! Summer is all about the watermelon~!
1800909	Did ya call~? Ho! Thought you'd get something~?^^
1800910	Do you want to see my beautiful self~?
1800911	Hohoho! Let's do it together~!
1800912	It's a giant watermelon if you raise it right~ And a watermelon slice if you mess up~!
1800913	Tada~ Transformation~ complete~!
1800914	Am I a rain watermelon? Or a defective watermelon?
1800915	Now! I've gotten big~! Everyone, come at me!
1800916	Get bigger~ Get stronger~! Tell me your wish~~!
1800917	A watermelon slice's wish! But I'm bigger already?
1800918	A large watermelon's wish! Well, try to break me!
1800919	I'm done growing~! I'm running away now~^^
1800920	If you let me go, I'll give you ten million Adena!
1800921	Freedom~! What do you think I have inside?
1800922	OK~ OK~ Good job. You know what to do next, right?
1800923	Look here! Do it right! You spilled! This precious...
1800924	Ah~ Refreshing! Spray a little more~!
1800925	Gulp gulp~ Great! But isn't there more?
1800926	Can't you even aim right? Have you even been to the army?
1800927	Did you mix this with water~? Why's it taste like this~!
1800928	Oh! Good! Do a little more. Yeah~
1800929	Hoho! It's not there! Over here~! Am I so small that you can even spray me right?
1800930	Yuck! What is this~! Are you sure this is nectar~?
1800931	Do your best~! I become a big watermelon after just five bottles~!
1800932	Of course~! Watermelon is the best nectar! Hahaha~!
1800933	Ahh! Good~ >_< Slap slap me~
1800934	Oww! You're just beating me now~ Give me nectar~
1800935	Look~!! It's gonna break~!
1800936	Now! Are you trying to eat without doing the work? Fine~ Do what you want~ I'll hate you if you don't give me any nectar!
1800937	Hit me more! Hit me more!
1800938	I'm gonna wither like this~ Damn it~!
1800939	Hey you~ If I die like this, there'll be no item either~ Are you really so stingy with the nectar?
1800940	It's just a little more!! Good luck~!
1800941	Save me~ I'm about to die without tasting nectar even once~
1800942	If I die like this, I'll just be a watermelon slice~!
1800943	Splendid! But I'm going to disappear in 30 seconds... so remember me kindly!
1800944	It's goodbye after 20 seconds~!
1800945	Yeah, 10 seconds left~! 9... 8... 7...!
1800946	I'm leaving in 2 minutes, if you don't give me any nectar~!
1800947	I'm leaving in a minute if you don't give me any nectar~!
1800948	I'm leaving now~! Then, goodbye~!
1800949	Sorry, but this large watermelon is disappearing here~!
1800950	Too late~!
1800951	Another time!
1800952	Too bad~! You raised it up, too! -_-
1800953	Oh~ What a nice sound~
1800954	The instrument is nice, but there's no song. Shall I sing for you?
1800955	What beautiful music!
1800956	I feel good~ Play some more!
1800957	My heart is being captured by the sound of Crono!
1800958	Get the notes right~! Hey old man~ That was wrong!
1800959	I like it~!
1800960	Ooh!.. My body wants to open!
1800961	Oh~! This chord! My heart is being torn! Play a little more!
1800962	It's this~ This! I wanted this sound! Why don't you try becoming a singer?
1800963	You can try a hundred times on this~ You won't get anything good~!
1800964	It hurts~! Play just the instrument~!
1800965	Only good music can open my body!
1800966	Not this, but you know, that~ What you got as a Chronicle souvenir. Play with that!
1800967	Why~ You have no music? Boring... I'm leaving now~
1800968	Not those sharp things~! Use the ones that make nice sounds!
1800969	Large watermelons only open with music~ Just striking with a weapon won't work~!
1800970	Strike with music~! Not with something like this. You need music~!
1800971	You're pretty amazing~! But it's all for nothing~~!
1800972	Use that on monsters, OK? I want Crono~!
1800973	Everyone~ The watermelon is breaking!!!
1800974	It's like a watermelon slice~!
1800975	A goblin is coming out(?)!
1800976	Large watermelon~! Make a wish!!
1800977	Don't tell anyone about my death~
1800978	Ugh~ The red juice is flowing out!
1800979	This is all~
1800980	Aaah!
1800981	Everyone~ This watermelon broke open!! The item is falling out!
1800982	Bang! It burst! The contents are spilling out...
1800983	Hohoho~ Play better!
1800984	Oh~!! You're very talented, huh~?
1800985	Play some more! More!  More!  More!
1800986	I eat hits and grow!!
1800987	Buck up~ There isn't much time~
1800988	Do you think I'll burst with just that~?
1800989	What a nice attack~ You might be able to kill a passing fly~
1800990	Right there! A little to the right~! Ah~ Refreshing.
1800991	You call that hitting? Bring some more talented friends!
1800992	Don't think! Just hit! We're hitting!
1800993	I need nectar~ Gourd nectar!
1800994	I can only grow by drinking nectar~
1800995	Grow me quick! If you're good, it's a large watermelon. If you're bad, it a watermelon slice~!
1800996	Gimme nectar~ I'm hungry~
1800997	Hurry and bring me nectar... Not a necktie~... (sorry)
1800998	Bring me nectar. Then, I'll drink and grow!
1800999	You wanna eat a tiny watermelon like me? Try giving me some nectar. I'll get huge~!
1801000	Hehehe... Grow me well and you'll get a reward. Grow me bad and who knows what'll happen~
1801001	You want a large watermelon? I'd like to be a watermelon slice~
1801002	Trust me and bring me some nectar!! I'll become a large watermelon for you~!
1801003	I see. Beleth has recovered all of its magic power. What remains here is just its trace.
1801004	Command Channel Leader $s1, Beleth' Ring has been acquired.
1801005	You summoned me, so you must be confident, huh? Here I come! Jack game!
1801006	Hello. Let's have a good Jack game.
1801007	I'm starting! Now, show me the card you want!
1801008	We'll start now! Show me the card you want!
1801009	I'm showing the Rotten Pumpkin Card!
1801010	I'll be showing the Rotten Pumpkin Card!
1801011	I'm showing the Jack Pumpkin Card!
1801012	I'll be showing the Jack Pumpkin Card!
1801013	That's my precious Fantastic Chocolate Banana Ultra Favor Candy!!! I'm definitely winning the next round!!
1801014	It's my precious candy, but... I'll happily give it to you~!
1801015	The candy fell. I'll give you my toy chest instead.
1801016	Since the candy fell, I will give you my toy chest instead.
1801017	You're not peeking at my card, are you? This time, I'll wager a special scroll.
1801018	We're getting serious now. If you win again, I'll give you a special scroll.
1801019	You could probably enter the underworld pro league!
1801020	Even pros can't do this much. You're amazing.
1801021	Who's the monster here?! This time, I'll bet my precious Transformation Stick.
1801022	I lost again. I won't lose this time. I'm betting my Transformation Stick.
1801023	Lost again! Hmph. Next time, I'll bet an incredible gift! Wait for it if you want!
1801024	You're too good. Next time, I'll give you an incredible gift! Please wait for you.
1801025	My pride can't handle you winning anymore!
1801026	I would be embarrassing to lose again here...
1801027	What's your name? I'm gonna remember you!
1801028	People from the above ground world are really good at games.
1801029	You've played a lot in the underworld, haven't you?!
1801030	I've never met someone so good before.
1801031	13 wins in a row. You're pretty lucky today, huh?
1801032	I never thought I would see 13 wins in a row.
1801033	This is the best record I've ever seen! Next time I'll give you my treasure - the Golden Jack O'Lantern!
1801034	Even pros can't do 14 wins in a row! Next time I'll give you my treasure - the Golden Jack O'Lantern.
1801035	I can't do this anymore! You win! I acknowledge you as the best I've ever met in all my 583 years!
1801036	Playing any more is meaningless. You were my greatest opponent.
1801037	I won this round...! It was fun.
1801038	I won this round. It was enjoyable.
1801039	Above world people are so fun...! Then, see you later!
1801040	Call me again next time. I want to play again with you.
1801041	You wanna play some more? I'm out of presents, but I'll give you candy!
1801042	Will you play some more? I don't have any more presents, but I will give you candy if you win.
1801043	You're the best. Out of all the Jack's game players I've ever met... I give up!
1801044	Wowww. Awesome. Really. I have never met someone as good as you before. Now... I can't play anymore.
1801045	$s1 has won $s2 Jack's games in a row.

1801048	Hello~! I'm Belldandy. Congratulations on winning 1st place in Jack's game... If you go and find my sibling Skooldie in the village, you'll get an amazing gift! Let's play Jack's game again!
1801049	Hmm. You're playing Jack's game for the first time, huh? You couldn't even take out your card at the right time~! My goodness...
1801050	Oh. You're not very familiar with Jack's game, right? You didn't take out your card at the right time...
1801051	You have to use the card skill on the mask before the gauge above my head disappears.
1801052	You must use the card skill on the mask before the gauge above my head disappears.
1801053	If you show the same card as me, you win. If they're different, I win. Understand? Now, let's go!
1801054	You will win if you show the same card as me. It's my victory if the cards are different. Well, let's start again~
1801055	Ack! You didn't show a card? You have to use the card skill before the gauge disappears. Hmph. Then, I'm going.
1801056	Ahh. You didn't show a card. You must use the card skill at the right time. It's unfortunate. Then, I will go now~
1801057	Let's learn about the Jack's game together~! You can play with me 3 times.
1801058	Let's start! Show the card you want! The card skill is attached to the mask.
1801059	You showed the same card as me, so you win.
1801060	You showed a different card from me, so you lose.
1801061	That was practice, so there's no candy even if you win~
1801062	It's unfortunate. Let's practice one more time.
1801063	You gotta show the card at the right time. Use the card skill you want before the gauge above my head disappears!
1801064	The card skills are attached to the Jack O'Lantern mask, right? That's what you use.
1801065	You win if you show the same card as me, and I win if the cards are different. OK, let's go~
1801066	You didn't show a card again? We'll try again later. I'm gonna go now~
1801067	Now, do you understand a little about Jack's game? The real game's with Uldie and Belldandy. Well, see you later!
1801068	Hahahaha!
1801069	Where are you looking?
1801070	I'm right here.
1801071	Annoying concentration attacks are disrupting Valakas' concentration!\nIf it continues, you may get a great opportunity!
1801072	Some warrior's blow has left a huge gash between the great scales of Valakas!\nValakas' P. Def. is greatly decreased!
1801073	Annoying concentration attacks overwhelmed Valakas, making it forget its rage and become distracted!
1801074	Long-range concentration attacks have enraged Valakas!\nIf you continue, it may become a dangerous situation!
1801075	Because the cowardly counterattacks continued, Valakas' fury has reached its maximum!\nValakas' P. Atk. is greatly increased!
1801076	Valakas has been enraged by the long-range concentration attacks and is coming toward its target with even greater zeal!
1801077	Listen, oh Tantas! I have returned! The Prophet Yugoros of the Black Abyss is with me, so do not be afraid!
1801078	Welcome, $s1! Let us see if you have brought a worthy offering for the Black Abyss!
1801079	What a formidable foe! But I have the Abyss Weed given to me by the Black Abyss! Let me see...
1801080	Muhahaha! Ah, this burning sensation in my mouth! The power of the Black Abyss is reviving me!
1801081	No! How dare you stop me from using the Abyss Weed... Do you know what you have done?!
1801082	A limp creature like this is unworthy to be an offering... You have no right to sacrifice to the Black Abyss!
1801083	Listen, oh Tantas! The Black Abyss is famished! Find some fresh offerings!
1801084	Ah... How could I lose... Oh, Black Abyss, receive me...
1801085	Alarm system destroyed. Intruder excluded.

1801091	The beast ate the feed, but it isn't showing a response, perhaps because it's already full.
1801092	The beast spit out the feed instead of eating it.
1801093	The beast spit out the feed and is instead attacking you!
1801094	$s1 is leaving you because you don't have enough Golden Spices.
1801095	$s1 is leaving you because you don't have enough Crystal Spices.
1801096	$s1. May the protection of the gods be upon you!
1801097	Freya has started to move.
1801098	How could I... fall... in a place like this...
1801099	I can finally take a breather. By the way, who are you? Hmm... I think I know who sent you.

1801111	Strong magic power can be felt from somewhere!!
1801112	How dare you attack my recruits!!
1801113	Who is disrupting the order?!
1801114	The drillmaster is dead!
1801115	Line up the ranks!!
1801116	I brought the food.
1801117	Come and eat.
1801118	Looks delicious.
1801119	Let's go eat.
1801120	Archer. Give your breath for the intruder!
1801121	My knights. Show your loyalty!!
1801122	I can take it no longer!!!
1801123	Archer. Heed my call!
1801124	The space feels like its gradually starting to shake.
1801125	I can no longer stand by.
1801126	Taklacan is gathering its strength and launching an attack.
1801127	Taklacan received Kokracon and became weaker.
1801128	Kokracon's power can be felt nearby.
1801129	Taklacan is preparing to hide itself.
1801130	Taklacan disappears into the space of futility with a roar.
1801131	Torumba's body is starting to move.
1801132	A response can be felt from Torumba's tough skin.
1801133	A mark remains on Torumba's tough skin.
1801134	The light is beginning to weaken in Torumba's eyes.
1801135	Torumba's left leg was damaged.
1801136	Torumba's right leg was damaged.
1801137	Torumba's left arm was damaged.
1801138	Torumba's right arm was damaged.
1801139	A deep wound appeared on Torumba's tough skin.
1801140	The light is slowly fading from Torumba's eyes.
1801141	Torumba is preparing to hide its body.
1801142	Torumba disappeared into his space.
1801143	Torumba is preparing to hide itself in the twisted space.
1801144	Dopagen has started to move.
1801145	Leptilikon's energy feels like it's being condensed.
1801146	Dopagen is preparing to hide itself with a strange scent.
1801147	Dopagen is preparing to hide itself.
1801148	Dopagen is disappearing in between the twisted space.
1801149	Maguen!
1801150	Enough Maguen Plasma - Bistakon have gathered.
1801151	Enough Maguen Plasma - Kokracon have gathered.
1801152	Enough Maguen Plasma - Leptilikon have gathered.
1801153	The plasmas have filled the aeroscope and are harmonized.
1801154	The plasmas have filled the aeroscope but they are ramming into each other, exploding, and dying.
1801155	Amazing. $s1 took 100 of these soul stone fragments. What a complete swindler.
1801156	Hmm? Hey, did you give $s1 something? But it was just 1. Haha.
1801157	$s1 pulled one with $s2 digits. Lucky~ Not bad~
1801158	It's better than losing it all, right? Or does this feel worse?
1801159	Ahem~!  $s1 has no luck at all. Try praying.
1801160	Ah... It's over. What kind of guy is that? Damn... Fine, you $s1, take it and get outta here.
1801161	A big piece is made up of little pieces. So here's a little piece~
1801162	You don't feel bad, right? Are you sad? But don't cry~
1801163	OK~ Who's next? It all depends on your fate and luck, right? At least come and take a look.
1801164	No one else? Don't worry~ I don't bite. Haha~!
1801165	There was someone who won 10,000 from me. A warrior shouldn't just be good at fighting, right? You've gotta be good in everything.
1801166	OK~ Master of luck? That's you? Haha~! Well, anyone can come after all.
1801167	Shedding blood is a given on the battleground. At least it's safe here.
1801168	Gasp!
1801169	Is it still long off?
1801170	Is Ermian well? Even I can't believe that I survived in a place like this...
1801171	I don't know how long it's been since I parted company with you... Time doesn't seem to move... It just feels too long...
1801172	Sorry to say this, but... The place you struck me before now hurts greatly...
1801173	Ugh... I'm sorry... It looks like this is it for me... I wanted to live and see my family...
1801174	Where are you? I can't see anything.
1801175	Where are you, really? I can't follow you like this.
1801176	I'm sorry... This is it for me.
1801177	Sob~ To see Ermian again... Can I go to my family now?
1801178	Whoa! Feels like my energy is back~!
1801179	I feel so light! This is it! I know this feeling!
1801180	Wow~ My fatigue is completely gone!
1801181	Hey~ that ominous feeling has disappeared!
1801182	My body feels as light as a feather~
1801183	I already feel more energetic. Thanks, $s1 -
1801184	How refreshing! You wouldn't happen to be a master masseuse, $s1, would you?
1801185	Incredible. From now on, I'll compare all massages to this one with $s1!
1801186	Wow! That's what I call a Cure-All!
1801187	I'm starving! I'll go find some meat.
1801188	Thank you, thank you!
1801189	Magic power so strong that it could make you lose your mind can be felt from somewhere!!
1801190	Even though you bring something called a gift among your humans, it would just be problematic for me...
1801191	I just don't know what expression I should have it appeared on me. Are human's emotions like this feeling?
1801192	The feeling of thanks is just too much distant memory for me...
1801193	But I kind of miss it... Like I had felt this feeling before...
1801194	I am Ice Queen Freya... This feeling and emotion are nothing but a part of Maliss'a memories.
1801195	Dear $s1... Think of this as my appreciation for the gift. Take this with you. There's nothing strange about it. It's just a bit of my capriciousness... 
1801196	The kindness of somebody is not a bad feeling... Dear $s1, I will take this gift out of respect your kindness.
1801197	$s1 $s2 $s3 min. remaining!

1911112	My brethren who are stronger than me will punish you. You will soon be covered in your own blood and crying in anguish!
1911113	How could I lose against these worthless creatures...?
1911114	Foolish creatures... the flames of hell are drawing closer.
1911115	No matter how you struggle this place will soon be covered with your blood.
1911116	Those who set foot in this place shall not leave alive.
1911117	Worthless creatures, I will grant you eternal sleep in fire and brimstone.

2010005	Nice to meet you
2010006	Please pet me.
2010007	Welcome to Ancient City Arcan!
2010008	I am the most handsome cat.
2010009	Today must be a lucky day.
2010010	It smells good.
2010011	Things are strange so I'm cautious.
2010012	You seem nice.
2010013	For Great General Kimerian!
2010014	Glory to Kimerian!
2010015	Eternity to Kimerian!
2010016	Devote Myself for the Glory of Kimerian!
2010017	For Kimerian!
2010018	Chrrk! Kimerian!
2010019	For the Glory of Kimerian!
2010020	Foreigners OUT!
2010021	Stop them!
2010022	For Great General Kimerian!
2010023	Failure is not acceptable...
2010024	Eternity to Kimerian!
2010025	No regrets until death
2010026	A faint breeze makes me sensitive
2010027	I'm ashamed that I can't confront my enemies
2010028	Defeat all of the resistance fighters!
2010029	Hurray Kimerian!
2010030	Great Leader Kimerian!
2010031	Go Advance!
2010032	All Attack!
2010033	Come one!
2010034	For the Freedom!
2010035	Ooh...
2010036	We can't stop here...
2010037	Please don't make my death fruitless...
2010038	Now! Before it's too late, we need to track Kimerian to catch him!
2010039	I don't think this is the right way.
2010040	We lost tracking Kimerian. Let's turn to another direction.
2010041	Tracking goes to another direction.
2010042	This seems to be a wrong direction.
2010043	Let's go upward deep inside the forest.
2010044	Tracking goes to the waterfall.
2010045	Let's continue on this road.
2010046	Let's keep going upward a bit more.
2010047	There Kimerian!
2010048	Found Kimerian!
2010049	Rotten Kimerian! This is the fury of Fairies!
2010050	Kimerian is hiding right there!
2010051	We found Kimerian hiding in the cave right there!
2010052	Followers of Kimerian!
2010053	For the Freedom of Fairies!
2010054	Ready!
2010055	Go! Wipe out Kimerian!
2010056	It smells in here.
2010057	Let's go in.
2010058	Let's go in.
2010059	My heart is pounding.
2010060	Until the end! Kimerian!
2010061	Kimerian! This is my revenge for the Fairy victims!
2010062	Kimerian! We are here to punish you!
2010063	This is my revenge for my comrades who were transformed and have disappeared!
2010064	How ridiculous! You think you can find me?
2010065	Then try. Ha ha ha.
2010066	You're still trying?
2010067	Ha ha ha ha...
2010068	Arrogant asses...! I won't forget this...!
2010069	You did it! Thank you!
2010070	Unfortunately, they ran away.
2010071	I'm going to die! Use glimmer on me!
2010072	Use glimmer on me!
2010073	You are a resistance fighter! Please take me with you!
2010074	We can find Sword of Revolution!
2010075	I hope this is helpful.
2010076	We defeated Kimerian!
2010077	I did it!
2010078	Whhiisshh!
2010079	You did well!
2010080	We defeated a tyrant!
2010081	Wooow!
2010082	Lalala~ Even though the Mother Tree is ill and the town is plagued...
2010083	I am so thankful that Rizraell is staying with me~
2010084	Dark energy is creeping in and Shillien is about to resurrect...
2010085	Let's give warm healings to each other~
2010086	La lalala~
2010087	Resurrect and open your eyes in the dark...
2010088	Then create more offerings of Shillien!
2010089	Kimerian ran away. Let's return to the village and talk. 
2010090	You did a lot of work! Let's go back to the village and have a congratulatory drink!
2010091	They are rookie rebellions.
2010092	Resistance underlings!
2010093	Treason is punishable by death.
2010094	Who do you think you are to try my authority!
2010095	Defeat! Kimerian!
2010096	For the Freedom of Fairies!
2010097	Phantom image!
2010098	Umm. You're still alive?
2010099	I won't let you get away any more!
2010100	How dare you came to me! This is where you'll be buried.
2010101	But you came this far, I should at least play with you a little.
2010102	Thank you!
2010103	Now I feel much better.
2010104	Energy is soaring!
2010105	I feel better!

1900003	Well? I win, right?
1900004	Now!! All of you losers, get out of here!
1900005	What a bunch of losers.
1900006	I guess you came to rescue Santa. But you picked the wrong opponent.
1900007	Oh, not bad...
1900008	Agh!! That's not what I meant to do!
1900009	Curse you!! Huh... What...?
1900010	Have you done nothing but rock-paper-scissors?! 
1900011	Stop it, no more... I did it because I was too lonely...
1900012	I have to release Santa... How infuriating!!!
1900013	I hate happy Happy Holidays!!! 
1900014	Oh. I'm bored.
1900015	Shall I go to see if Santa is still there? Hehe~
1900016	Oh ho ho.... Happy Holidays!! 
1900017	Santa can give nice presents only if he's released from the Turkey...
1900018	Oh ho ho! Thank you! I will reward you for sure.
1900019	Happy Holidays~ Well done. 
1900020	Happy Holidays~ Thank you for rescuing me from that wretched Turkey.

1900023	Take a look at the inventory. I hope you like the gift I gave you. 
1900024	Take a look at the inventory. Perhaps there will be a big present~
1900025	I'm tired of dealing with you. I'm leaving.
1900026	When are you going to stop? I'm slowly getting tired of this.
1900027	Message from Santa: Many blessings to  $s1, who saved me~
1900028	How dare you awaken me. Feel the pain of the flames.
1900029	Who dares oppose the majesty of fire...?

1900040	Idiot! I only incur damage from bare-handed attacks!
1900041	You summoned me, so you must be confident, huh? Here I come! Jack game!
1900042	Hello. Let's have a good Jack game.
1900043	I'm starting! Now, show me the card you want!
1900044	We'll start now! Show me the card you want!
1900045	I'm showing the Rotten Pumpkin Card!
1900046	I'll be showing the Rotten Pumpkin Card!
1900047	I'm showing the Jack Pumpkin Card!
1900048	I'll be showing the Jack Pumpkin Card!
1900049	That's my precious Fantastic Chocolate Banana Ultra Favor Candy!!! I'm definitely winning the next round!!
1900050	It's my precious candy, but... I'll happily give it to you~!
1900051	I'm out of candy. I'll give you my toy chest instead.
1900052	Since I'm out of candy, I will give you my toy chest instead.
1900053	You're not peeking at my card, are you? This time, I'll wager a special scroll.
1900054	We're getting serious now. If you win again, I'll give you a special scroll.
1900055	You could probably enter the underworld pro league!
1900056	Even pros can't do this much. You're amazing.
1900057	Who's the monster here?! This time, I'll bet my precious Transformation Stick.
1900058	I lost again. I won't lose this time. I'm betting my Transformation Stick.
1900059	Lost again! Hmph. Next time, I'll bet an incredible gift! Wait for it if you want!
1900060	You're too good. Next time, I'll give you an incredible gift! Please wait for you.
1900061	My pride can't handle you winning anymore!
1900062	I would be embarrassing to lose again here...
1900063	What's your name? I'm gonna remember you!
1900064	People from the above ground world are really good at games.
1900065	You've played a lot in the underworld, haven't you?!
1900066	I've never met someone so good before.
1900067	13 wins in a row. You're pretty lucky today, huh?
1900068	I never thought I would see 13 wins in a row.
1900069	This is the best record I've ever seen! Next time I'll give you my treasure - the Golden Jack O'Lantern!
1900070	Even pros can't do 14 wins in a row! Next time I'll give you my treasure - the Golden Jack O'Lantern.
1900071	I can't do this anymore! You win! In all my 583 years, you're the best that I've seen!
1900072	Playing any more is meaningless. You were my greatest opponent.
1900073	I won this round...! It was fun.
1900074	I won this round. It was enjoyable.
1900075	Above world people are so fun...! Then, see you later!
1900076	Call me again next time. I want to play again with you.
1900077	You wanna play some more? I'm out of presents, but I'll give you candy!
1900078	Will you play some more? I don't have any more presents, but I will give you candy if you win.
1900079	You're the best. Out of all the Jack's game players I've ever met... I give up!
1900080	Wowww. Awesome. Really. I have never met someone as good as you before. Now... I can't play anymore.
1900081	$s1 has won $s2 Jack's games in a row.
1900082	Congratulations! $s1 has won $s2 Jack's games in a row.
1900083	Congratulations on getting 1st place in Jack's game!
1900084	Hello~! I'm Belldandy. Congratulations on getting 1st place in Jack's game. If you go and find my sibling Skooldie in the village, you'll get an amazing gift! Let's play Jack's game again!
1900085	Hmm. You're playing Jack's game for the first time, huh? You couldn't even take out your card at the right time~! My goodness...
1900086	Oh. You're not very familiar with Jack's game, right? You didn't take out your card at the right time...
1900087	You have to use the card skill on the mask before the gauge above my head disappears.
1900088	You must use the card skill on the mask before the gauge above my head disappears.
1900089	If you show the same card as me, you win. If they're different, I win. Understand? Now, let's go!
1900090	You will win if you show the same card as me. It's my victory if the cards are different. Well, let's start again~
1900091	Ack! You didn't show a card? You have to use the card skill before the gauge disappears. Hmph. Then, I'm going.
1900092	Ahh. You didn't show a card. You must use the card skill at the right time. It's unfortunate. Then, I will go now~
1900093	Let's learn about the Jack's game together~! You can play with me 3 times.
1900094	Let's start! Show the card you want! The card skill is attached to the mask.
1900095	You showed the same card as me, so you win.
1900096	You showed a different card from me, so you lose.
1900097	That was practice, so there's no candy even if you win~
1900098	It's unfortunate. Let's practice one more time.
1900099	You gotta show the card at the right time. Use the card skill you want before the gauge above my head disappears!
1900100	The card skills are attached to the Jack O'Lantern mask, right? That's what you use.
1900101	You win if you show the same card as me, and I win if the cards are different. OK, let's go~
1900102	You didn't show a card again? We'll try again later. I'm gonna go now~
1900103	Now, do you understand a little about Jack's game? The real game's with Uldie and Belldandy. Well, see you later!
1900104	Yawn~ Ahh... Hello~! Nice weather we're having.
1900105	Ah, I'm hungry. Do you have any baby food? That's what I need to eat to get bigger.
1900106	I gotta grow up fast. I want to pull Santa's sled, too.
1900107	Yummy! I think I can grow up now!
1900108	Thanks to you, I grew up into a Boy Rudolph!
1900109	It's great weather for running around.
1900110	What'll I be when I grow up? I wonder.
1900111	If you take good care of me, I'll never forget it!
1900112	Please pet me lovingly. You can use the "Hand of Warmth" skill under the action tab.
1900113	I feel great! Thank you!
1900114	Woo. What a good feeling~ I gotta grow more and more!
1900115	Oh, yummy! If I keep eating this, I think I can grow up all the way.
1900116	Yum yum. Delicious. Give me more of this!
1900117	Wow. This taste. There's a whole new world in my mouth!
1900118	Yeah. It's so delicious. This is that star food!
1900119	Pay some attention to me! Hmph.
1900120	Thank you. I was able to grow up into an adult. Here is my gift.
1900121	Thank you, $s1. Now, I can pull the sled.
1900122	$s1. Thank you for taking care of me all this time. I enjoyed it very much.
1900123	$s1. It won't be long now until it becomes time to pull the sled. It's too bad.
1900124	I must return to Santa now. Thank you for everything!
1900125	Hello. I'm a girl Rudolph. I was able to find my true self thanks to you.
1900126	This is my gift of thanks. Thank you for taking care of me~
1900127	$s1. I was always grateful.
1900128	I'm a little sad. It's time to leave now.
1900129	$s1. The time has come for me to return to my home.
1900130	$s1, thank you!
1900131	Hahaha!!! I captured Santa!! Huh? Where is this? Who are you?
1900132	...I lost at Rock Paper Scissors and was taken captive... I might as well take out my anger on you! Huh~ What?
1900133	Nothing's working... I'm leaving! I'll definitely capture Santa again! Just you wait!
1900134	I must raise Rudolph quickly. This year's Christmas gifts have to be delivered...
1900135	Happy Holidays~ Thanks to your efforts in raising Rudolph, the gift delivery was a success.
1900136	In 10 min., it will be 1 h. since you started raising me.
1900137	After 5 min., if my Full Feeling and Affection Level reach 99%%, I can grow bigger.

1900139	Want to test your luck? Give me Adena!
1900140	If you give me Adena 5 times, I will test your luck!
1900141	Yummy. I feel good today!
1900142	Yamyam. This doesn't feel very good.
1900143	I'm full~ I'll tell your fortune!
1900144	Thank you. See you later~
1900145	Today is the best day of your life! Congratulations! Only good things will come today.
1900146	You're very lucky today! You should enchant on days like this!
1900147	Ha.. Sorry, but today is not looking very good. Watch out for monsters!
1900148	Death! Death is near! No one can do anything about it! Muhaha... Ahhahahaha!
1900149	Everyone.. Turn into flesh! Kekekeke... 
1900150	Black color ate.. all... of red blood! Understand?!
1900151	All gonna die! Smashed like meat.. Will get sucked into the darkness!
1900152	I don't wanna die... sniff.. I... don't want to die like that..
1900153	Don't...come.. Go away! Ahh...ahhh!
1900154	Give you life to the Goddess of Death! Kahahaha!
1900155	It's not yet complete! Death! Is not yet complete!
1900156	No.. I.. can't die like this. Go...go away! 
1900157	I saw.. blood.. torn flesh... getting...sucked into... the ground... 
1900158	Ughh.... blood.. drips... bone.... crushed... 
1900159	Voice.. was good... as if you're possessed... No! I'm already possessed!
1900160	I heard the sound. Sacrifice your blood now. You'll resurrect later! Kehehehe!
1900161	Don't die! But, you will. I will! You too! Hehehe!
1900162	I saw... the end of darkness... I had to give up.
1900163	Flesh rips...bone crushes. Haha...hehehe...it's red. All!
1900164	I do not...want to die. I don't want to...die miserably like that!
1900165	Go away! I do not want to see anyone! No... Don't leave me! I'm scared!
1900166	I didn't want to see. Hehe.. But, I saw.. I saw! Hehehehe!
1900167	I heard the sound. Sound of the hell!
1900168	Let me.. live!! Please! Help me! That black ground is trying to swallow me!
1900169	Hundreds and thousands of monsters turned into flesh! Kehehehe!
1900170	I was swallowed after smashed. By darkness! Into the darkness!
1900171	I don't like it! Don't touch me! Please.. I beg you... Sniff... Sniff...
1900172	Sweet voice. Hehe.. You die if you get possessed by that sound. Like them! Hehe...hahaha!
1900173	They will resurrect. She will... They will... Heh... 
1900174	Dead.. or alive... I don't want to see anything..
1900175	Death. No one can do anything! Deep! Deep death!
1900176	Even if you try, it's useless. Die with me. Keheheh!
1900177	Dark voice.. Can you hear? I.. can hear.. But... I don't want to.. 
1900178	I can still hear the sound.. of flesh and bones grinding. Hehehehe!
1900179	Eek! Run away! If you want to live... If you want to stay alive! Leave here! Right now!
1900180	You don't want to die? But, you'll die soon. Keheheh!
1900181	There's no chance! No chance at all! You! And I will! Become red flesh! Keheheh! 
1900182	Die! Before she swallows you! Die!
1900183	Don't wanna die. But, I can't live either. Sniff... Sniff... 
1900184	Eek! Don't kill me! I don't wanna die. I don't wanna become a patty of meat.. No.. No! 
1900185	I can hear.. the bone crushing sound..
1900186	I saw the sea of blood. That day..I.. Ahhhh!
1900187	I couldn't run.. I saw... Everything! I was already dead then. Kehe...hahaha..
1900188	I'm gonna get caught! Then you'll die! Ahh! God have forsaken us!
1900189	I want to live! I don't want to be swallowed to death!
1900190	Nothing comes out neither from inside or outside.
1900191	As it didn't exist 
1900192	It left nothing behind.. 
1900193	Should we report it to the kingdom?
1900194	I'm in a pickle. We can't go back. Let's look further.
1900195	We'll begin internal purification process.
1900196	Thank you. 
1900197	Nothing can be found. 
1900198	As if it didn't exist from the beginning 
1900199	Hmm... 
1900200	I heard the witness went crazy after this incident. 
1900201	I think we must begin purifying this bad aura before we do anything. 
1900202	I will report to Kingdom. 
1900203	Yes. You can do that. 
1900204	From what I heard from the witness, I heard the monsters were completely ripped apart and absorbed into the ground. 
1900205	He's a crazy man, so it's not so credible... 
1900206	Sigh.. It doesn't make sense that this brutal scene has nothing left behind. 
1900207	What can I even do?
1900208	Let's report it to the kingdom first. 
1900209	I see.
1900210	A crazy man said all the monsters were shredded and absorbed into the ground. 
1900211	What do you think? 
1900212	Unbelievable words from unbelievable man. 
1900213	I think so too. But, there's no practical way to explain why the monsters have disappeared.  
1900214	Well... Whatever the case, we'll begin internal purification process.  
1900215	Yes. Then I will report back to the Kingdom. 
1900216	I can't believe it. 
1900217	Monsters all disappeared at once... 
1900218	I never felt this kind of deep darkness before. 
1900219	I wonder if we can purify this. 
1900220	This may be difficult, but please.  
1900221	Stop outsiders from approaching. 
1900222	I see. 
1900223	Sigh..
1900224	Other places can't seem to find anything either. 
1900225	If it's even possible for all monsters to disappear from all catacombs and necropolis... 
1900226	The witness went crazy. He's not being very helpful. 
1900227	I think we must eliminate this dark aura first.
1900228	I think you should investigate afterwards. 
1900229	Thank you. 
1900230	Do you think it's possible for all monsters to disappear at once? 
1900231	I.. don't believe that it's possible.
1900232	I don't think it's possible... 
1900233	The witness went crazy. His words are meaningless. 
1900234	Sigh.. It's tiring trying to guess. 
1900235	First.. Please take care of the purification process. 
1900236	Then I will report back to the Kingdom. 
1900237	I see. 
1900238	I'm worried. 
1900239	Other places can't seem to find anything either. 
1900240	Do you think it's possible for all monsters to disappear from all catacombs and necropolis?
1900241	The witness went crazy. He's not being very helpful. 
1900242	I think we must eliminate this dark aura first. 
1900243	Thank you.
1900244	Ahh.. What should we do with this situation... 
1900245	Calm down. 
1900246	Does it even make sense that all monsters from Catacomb and Necropolis disappeared?
1900247	This has never happened in the past. 
1900248	First.. Calm down... 
1900249	Shillien... Shillien isn’t going to be resurrected... 
1900250	Sigh.. First... I will start with purification process. 
1900251	When you're calm, please report to the kingdom. 
1900252	What do you think? 
1900253	This doesn't seem like an ordinary situation. 
1900254	If that crazy man's words are true... Monsters... May have been... absorbed by Shillien. 
1900255	Shillien.. I don't even know how to report for this. 
1900256	I will purify this place first. 
1900257	Thank you. 
1900258	What he said is out of ordinary.  
1900259	The monsters were shredded into pieces and absorbed into the ground... 
1900260	This is not something any person can do. 
1900261	Then... I see... Shillien sounds like a viable theory. 
1900262	It may not be the truth. 
1900263	You may be correct.
1900264	We should report to the Kingdom first.
1900265	I see. 
1900266	Ha.. I have no idea. 
1900267	I can't find any trace. Any trace of the monsters!
1900268	Calm down. 
1900269	No race can do such thing. 
1900270	If anyone could... he would be 'God.'
1900271	First.. We'll purify this evil aura. 
1900272	Thank you. 
1900273	We'll go into investigation when the purification is complete. 
1900274	I see. 
1900275	What do you think about what that crazy man said?
1900276	It sounds like crazy talk from a crazy man?
1900277	When there's no proof... Don't you think it sounds pretty credible?
1900278	You're putting too much weight into it.
1900279	It's unrealistic that all monsters would disappear at once. 
1900280	Even if you believe that... there's really not much we can do. 
1900281	Please purify inside of the building. 
1900282	I see. 
1900283	It's a strange thing. 
1900284	Right. It's definitely not a human being can do. 
1900285	Monsters all disappeared at once... 
1900286	Do you think God did this? 
1900287	Someone who can do this... is probably... Goddess of Death...
1900288	That's the worst guess. 
1900289	I think it's best that we do not tell the Kingdom yet. 
1900290	We must find something that can be a clue... 
8888100	Harken to me! Great Goddess Shillien was defeated.
8888101	Sacrifice of blood for resurrection and destruction!
8888102	Great Goddess of Destruction
8888103	Drink the sacrifice of blood that we have
8888104	and bring down the hammer of justice!
8888105	For the destruction and resurrection!
8888106	The increased grasp of dark energy causes the ground to shake.
8888107	Light power seeps out from the town center.
8888108	Dark power seeps out from the town center.
8888109	Please, let us go!
8888110	Let us live!!
8888111	I don't wanna die!
8888112	Mom...
8888113	Oh Einhasad...
8888114	Cough! Cough! My body is rotting...
8888115	Dirty Shillien's dogs!
8888116	Ahhk!
8888117	Ughh...!
8888118	You feel yourself being dragged to another location.
8888119	On your way to the spirit world of light, you suddenly feel a dark aura surrounding you. 
8888120	$s1...You ended up giving rotting dark to them! Darkness will never disappear. I will be back!
8888121	$s1! Cannot give them decaying darkness!

1032315	It's dangerous out there if you don't know what you're doing.

11021701	I saw they use not only Hermuncus' Minion teleports but Sayune too.
11021702	It's because they have become Awaken… the power of the Giant's.
11021703	Duh, you can't use Sayune without powers of Giants in the first place.
11021704	I think that's why many people come to visit Celphine.
11021705	After Ye Sagira fell there were many sacrifices made.
11021706	Didn't that release the seal on Hermuncus?
11021707	That's the rumor, but nothing to confirm it.

10338030	Prove your worth… 
10338031	Are you strong or weak... Of the Light or darkness…
10338032	Only those of light may pass. Others must prove their strength. 
10338033	Warrior. I've finally got out of seal of light thanks to you. 
10338034	Is strength to defend the world what you wanted?

1811334	Are you ready to bust a groove?
1811335	Wow, $s1 has serious moves!
1811336	Oh, I'm so embarrassed...
1811337	$s1 seems a little shy.
1811338	Wahaha~ How fun! 
1811339	Put your hands up!
1811340	You obtained a poisonous Tama... Thank you, $s1.
1811341	I am looking for the poisonous Tama that only grows in the Cruma Marshlands, the Swamp of Screams, and the Bloody Swampland.
1811342	Have you obtained the plant? I will send you to the Cardia Adventurer.

1801332	Victory?! Victory?! Please come back after more honing.
1801333	Huh? That tickles... Is that the best you can do?
1801334	Huh? That kinda hurts. I don't like it~!
1801335	Gasp... How could I fall in just $s1 seconds...?!
1801336	My strength explodes with my sword dance!!!
1801337	My strength is multiplying!! Hahaha!!!
1801338	Forget about getting out of here alive...!
1801339	You hit me? Go ahead, try again!
1801340	The Guillotine is full of power. It's shooting out.
1801341	Now... Feel my invincibility...
1801342	I have decided to settle in this fortress. So get out of here!
1801343	Look around... Do you think you can defeat all of them?
1801344	Even if the fires of hell surround me...!
1801345	I will feed your corpses to the Mandragoras.
1801346	Stop your breathing! You have the stench of the living.
1801347	Guillotine! These humans dare to attack you.
1801348	I curse those whom I have killed!
1801349	Kyahahaha, stop making me laugh! That tickles!
1801350	Stop! That's enough.
1801351	I can't move...
1801352	Ooooh...
1801353	Argh!!
1801354	This can't be...!
1801355	Curses!
1801356	So, there are those who dare to challenge this sharp blade...

1801358	Now, you won't feel pain or suffering anymore...!
1801359	My whole body was born away, and I drowned in suffering...
1801360	Now, it is your turn to taste my suffering!
1801361	Kekeke... I have become accustomed to this pain.
1801362	Those who hear my screams will understand my pain...
1801363	Do not come any closer! The nightmare of death is coming!
1801364	Depart from me! Stop causing me pain...
1801365	Each day is painful. This body...
1801366	I was falsely accused... And I lost my eyes to torture...
1801367	My broken body can no longer hold a sword...
1801368	I survive on these things that surround my body.
1801369	Why?! If I had known the reason, I wouldn't have died with such regret.
1801370	I was a talented knighthood. But look at me now...
1801371	I must live in this body. It is unfair...
1801372	I was torn apart without a reason. I despised everything.
1801373	I will never forgive them! Never!
1801374	I want to rest for eternity... Who bothers me now?
1801375	You should be careful. You might die!
1801376	Hohoho... Do I look pitiful? That makes my anger rise.
1801377	Cry! Cry out! 
1801378	See my appearance and suffer...
1801379	Sever!!!
1801380	I will punish everyone who turned me into this!
1801381	Stop tormenting me.
1801382	Aaah!
1801383	Keuk!
1801384	The suffering ends...!
1801385	I shall curse you from the grave.
1801386	Kyaaaaaaaahhhhh!
1801387	Sh! Sh! Shhhhhhh! Sssss....
1801388	K.. k.. kkkkk....!
1801389	Hakum! Daigan-dalaolsum!
1801390	Kkk... Kyaahh!
1801391	Bombomsara-bombomupsalla!
1801392	Sarasara bujarasarasara!!
1801393	Bukijika bukaja
1801394	Peeuuuukkkk!
1801395	Ack!
1801396	Taaak tak!
1801397	Oooo Oooo...
1801398	Hyak!
1801399	Heuooo...
1801400	Kh ah ah ah! 
1801401	Kh oh oh oh!
1801402	Keu... ooo...
1801403	Kaaahhh!
1801404	Krrrr...!!
1801405	Kuuuuu
1801406	Urggghh....!
1801407	If you wish to entrust your body to the guillotine, then come on!
1801408	Do you want the puppet experience?
1801409	Hazkal, I will accept the orders of the Guillotine and remove these purities.
1801410	I will offer them as a sacrifice to the guillotine.
1801411	Those who enter the fortress without permission have nothing to say!
1801412	I can hear a scream.
1801413	What a strange weapon. It's all shiny and cute.
1801414	I will destroy you one by one.
1801415	Submit to me, the faithful right-hand man.
1801416	Lose hope! Despair! Then, die!
1801417	Yes, it's this feeling! The feeling of striking you down!
1801418	You shall wither and die beneath the great guillotine fortress!
1801419	Your blood shall fill this fortress.
1801420	Kahahaha kyahahaha!
1801421	That tickles!
1801422	Oh guillotine! Great guillotine! See them!!
1801423	I'm warning you! Stop right here.
1801424	I am eternal! I am Hazkal, the closets being to the end of all things!
1801425	I don't want to die! I don't want to die for the second time!
1801426	Save me~
1801427	I still have a lot of souls to eat!
1801428	Gasp!
1801429	Urgh!
1801430	Oh guillotine, invaders have entered.
1801431	The darkness will swallow you up.
1801432	Binding, and the esthetics of tossing out
1801433	Blocking, and the power of force
1801434	Gasp
1801435	Keuk!
1801436	Urgh...!
1801437	Ooh...
1801438	You! The one hiding there!
1801439	My bowstring never rests.
1801440	I protect the guillotine fortress. Challenge me.
1801441	I will pierce you without end!
1801442	Fight fairly!
1801443	I shall have to report to Houpon.
1801444	I shall pierce your heart.
1801445	I will give you rest with the arrow of despair.
1801446	Do not take lightly the archers of the guillotine fortress!
1801447	You have to give me time to set up! I'm losing my mind.
1801448	Focused attack! 
1801449	Ack!
1801450	Ooo... ooo...
1801451	I surrender! I surrender!
1801452	Houpon! I must call Houpon.
1801453	Houpon! Please avenge me.
1801454	I must report to Houpon.
1801455	Suffering... Lost... Forgetting...
1801456	Eternal life... Absorb... Resurrection...
1801457	Prophecy...
1801458	Slaughter... Contempt...
1801459	Future... Choice...
1801460	Death...
1801461	Beheading...
1801462	It's no fun if you die in one blow, right?
1801463	My sharp blade is thirsty for your blood...
1801464	Do not interfere. Are you using violence inside the fortress?!
1801465	There are mountains of corpses of those who attacked me without taking me seriously...
1801466	I will slash your flesh with this rune sword!
1801467	Huhuhu... What curious people you are.
1801468	Slowly... And with suspense!
1801469	You're laughing? Go ahead! Then, you will die.
1801470	Taste the sharpness of my blade and die.
1801471	Stab and twist. Simple, right?
1801472	My sword will cut through your armor like paper.
1801473	Ha!
1801474	What a pathetic end to carelessness...
1801475	I cannot stand any longer.
1801476	A bit more... Clench the teeth! Kyah!
1801477	Now, don't die too easily.
1801478	I am the guillotine. If you remember me from the past, that will be your carelessness.
1801479	See this nightmarish truth. How would you like to see your comrades die?
1801480	Your group attacks so easily. I am alone.
1801481	Swing and strike! You are just a lump of flesh.
1801482	Puhahahahaha! This is fun!
1801483	You killed many of my subordinates.
1801484	You can stand it, right? Good! That's good! Hahaha!
1801485	I'm getting more and more excited!
1801486	Insects! Insignificant bugs to be killed!
1801487	I'm the boss of this place! How dare you act with such impudence!!!
1801488	I'm feeling power! Must be Katarsis on the battlefield! Hahaha!
1801489	I hate all of you who are alive!
1801490	Undead? Don't label me so easily!
1801491	Kuhahahahaha! C'mon! Try some more!!
1801492	I will tear your soul at the tip of my spear.
1801493	Protect feelings? When you die, die with certainty!
1801494	This fortress is not your playground! How dare you!
1801495	Sadness surrounds me.
1801496	Do you know how it feels to die on those you love?
1801497	I will bring peace back to this place.
1801498	The guillotine of death is hiding your identity.
1801499	The guillotine always makes me cower.
1801500	Sometimes, I cannot accept my death.
1801501	I died without mercy in this place.
1801502	My brutal curse keeps me trapped in this place.
1801503	I cannot rely on anyone anymore.
1801504	Hurry and escape from this place...
1801505	I love you. Please don't forget me.
1801506	I really didn't want to die.
1801507	You! Can you see me?
1801508	This place is all filled with suffocating darkness!
1801509	My body was beaten to a pulp.
1801510	I will never forget the face of my torturer...!
1801511	My entire body was destroyed by fear.
1801512	No! Go away! Don't let anyone come toward me...!
1801513	I left my family behind and was dragged to this place.
1801514	If I let go of my grudge, will I be able to escape from this place?
1801515	I want to feel the ground under my feet. But I no longer have any weight.
1801516	Hot! Too hot!
1801517	The air here feels like it's burning!
1801518	Get away! Get that fire away from me!
1801519	Ack! AAAHHHH!!
1801520	I'm always covered in sweat. So pitiful...
1801521	I don't know how many times I pleaded for my life.
1801522	Please destroy the guillotine. That is my wish!
1801523	Crackle crackle... That sound drives me crazy.
1801524	I remember the eyes of the monsters that looked upon me...
1801525	Please... just kill me...
1801526	I hate red. The color of fire... and blood...
1801527	Kkk... Did you see that mysterious image at night?
1801528	I want to see the image that appears in the darkness.
1801529	Darkness and annihilation. Don't those words go well together?
1801530	Things you cannot see during the day appear at night.
1801531	Don't walk around carelessly. You might die in an instant!
1801532	Rare life forms appear here from time to time.
1801533	Have you ever held the Proof of Survival in your hand?
1801534	They say that the monster that carries around treasure holds it.
1801535	Isn't it illogical to search for money in a barren land?
1801536	Let go of your greed. There is a greater reward waiting for you.
1801537	Let go of the things you desire, so that good fortune finds you...
1801538	Treasure the time that you have, even if it's only 10 min.
1801539	People can obtain a great fortune in a short amount of time.
1801540	Don't worry about me. I will speak the truth until my dying day.
1801541	The mandragora plants had many varieties.
1801542	Skull Dissect... That monster doesn't dare show itself.
1801543	Do not fear their shields. It is just an illusion.
1801544	Do not obsess over the small things. Look with a wide view...
1801545	Their shields are strong. But they are also careless!
1801546	Hun.. hungry...
1801547	You want a piece of me!
1801548	If it's a lot, I'll eat more.
1801549	Wooowww!
1801550	No way! Stop! Ack!
1801551	You lot...!!
1801552	I'm getting hungry.
1801553	Your kids are really cute. 
1801554	Have a good and safe day.
1801555	Who's there?
1801556	Where do you think you are?
1801557	Hey, stop!
1801558	You killed our baby!
1801559	Kyah! I won't forgive you!
1801560	Even if I die, I can't forgive you. We'll die together!
1801561	Everyone, come here.
1801562	Babies, you mustn't stray from your mom.
1801563	What should we have for dinner?
1801564	Mom, I'm hungry.
1801565	Mom and Dad, let's play.
1801566	Yap yap yap.
1801567	Stop fooling around and get to work!
1801568	Stop goofing off. Want a time-out? Or a spanking?
1801569	It's too late. Don't you know that it should have ended 30 minutes ago?
1801570	My machine is big and beautiful~
1801571	My machine is awesome~
1801572	Ooh yah~
1801573	Hey, wipe that correctly.
1801574	Come here and give me a massage. Nanim is still working and is probably tired.
1801575	A caterpillar should eat pine needles, right? Kekeke.

538150	Hurry and go find Commander Kbaldir.
538151	You can reach the Seed of Hellfire through the Seed Teleport Device.
538152	I will look forward to your activity.
538250	Now! Drive out that Tauti and his followers!
538251	We are free! Feel the joy of victory?
538350	Fergason. He is a good Dwarf. Go ahead and meet him.
538351	Try to handle it discretely rather than drawing attention.
538352	Hoho. You look pretty useful.
538450	Then, I will entrust this to you. Hohoho.
538451	Mind your manners when you see Lord Tauti, alright?
538452	Hahaha! Now, my dream can finally come true!
75450	You can find the Kundas on the 2nd floor of the Seed of Hellfire.
75451	Well done. I hope you will do well tomorrow as well.
75452	Receive the mission from Sizrak again tomorrow.
75550	You can obtain Petras by defeating Zofans.
75551	Well done. Then, I will see you tomorrow. Huhuhu.
75552	Find Lord Aku tomorrow and receive another mission.
1801582	The Chaos Shield is shattered and the true form is revealed!
1801583	Don't come this way!
1801584	This rat-like world!
1801585	What a big rat. Today will be a feast. 
1801586	It sure is nice to be free from having to go to the bathroom.
1801587	Kahahaha kyahahaha!
1801588	Why did I come here? This lot!
1801589	This is all Tauti's fault!
1801590	What a worthwhile day!.
1801591	Today was terrible. I only caught 3 rats.
1801592	I'm hope to be an Engineer someday.
1801593	Today's dinner is a huge rat roast.
1801594	Get it right, or you're done! There's plenty Zofans that want this work.
1801595	Upward mobility? Don't make me laugh.
1801596	Well done. That rat body is your reward. Hahaha.
1801597	If you don't do better today, that's it for you!
1801598	What a nuisance you worthless creatures are!
1300168	Let us drive out the power of darkness.
1300169	Drive out the power of darkness along side our revolutionary forces. 
1300170	I feel that the powers of darkness are growing stronger.
1300171	We will execute our plan on Sunday night. If you join us, I will give you a substantial reward.
1300172	When the world plunges into chaos, we will need your help. We hope you join us when the time comes. 
1801599	Everyone die!
1801600	For Tauti!
1801601	Fools. I will make this a habitat for the rats. They shall feed on your body!
1801602	How dare you insects attack me?
1801603	You rat-like creatures!
1801604	Today is a feasting day for my weapon - on your Petras!
1801605	Hahahaha hahahaha puny insects!
1801606	Everyone die!
1801607	For Tauti!
1801608	I will punish you in the name of Tauti! The crime is stealing. The punishment is death!
1801609	Fight for the sake of our future!
1801610	Even rats struggle when you step on them!
1801611	For our friends and family!
1801612	You worthless Kundas! My weapon may not be the bst, but it's still enough to cut your heads off!
1801613	Give me freedom or give me death!
1801614	Us! Today! Here! We shall write new history by defeating Tauti! For freedom and happiness!
1801615	We are neither livestock nor pets! 
1801616	You will die!     And I will live.
1801617	We cannot forgive Tauti for feeding on us anymore!
1801618	Fight for the sake of our future!
1801619	If we all fall here, our plan will certainly fail. Please protect my friends.
1801620	Kill that $s1 over there first. He is too ugly.
1801621	Flood in, my followers. I grant you permission.
1801622	Do you need my help. Here it is.
1801623	The plan has failed. Everyone, retreat!

1717807	What, new sacrificial offerings for Lord Triol?
1717808	You'll be brainwashed just by the sound of Lord Triol's voice!
1717809	You're nothing but sacrifices to be offered up to Lord Triol! I'll chew you bone to bone! Except for your earrings.
1717810	Lord Triol, please let us hear your voice again!
1717811	We must find creatures to sacrifice to Lord Triol.
1717812	Is this where I can find creatures to sacrifice for Lord Triol?
1717813	Found you! Consider it an honor to be offered up to Lord Triol.
1717814	So weak-looking… must be easy to snatch away.
1717815	Where did they go? Hmm… we'll withdraw for now. Can't find anything to serve as offerings here.
1717816	I heard this is where I could find them… I guess I'll have to look elsewhere.

1802194	Lyn Draco appears due to $s1's party.
1802195	You won't lay a finger on His Majesty Travis!
1802196	What is this sickening aura…?
1802197	His Majesty Travis has charged me with the duty to protect. And protect I shall!
1802198	I hear His Majesty's voice…I hear it every waking moment…
1802199	Hah! My body is hale yet!
1802200	Behold…my power!
1802201	A long slumber has come to an end…
1802202	Long have I waited for His Majesty's call… 
1802203	I will destroy you, just as I have destroyed the enemy forces!
1802204	You…!
1802205	What...what is this power…?

1802219	A mysterious power has taken residence in me…
1802220	My ears…they keep ringing!
1802221	What is this! So disorienting!
1802222	So you killed my comrades, did you?!
1802223	I will avenge my fallen comrades…
1802224	Let me be blind…let me be deaf… but I will not stop!!
1802225	Remember our history…our glorious history!
1802226	I cannot…I will not…back down!

1802228	My slumbering muscles begin to wake…
1802229	No use trying your petty tricks!

1802252	Imbecile…
1802253	Shame on you!
1802254	Are you not ashamed before the gods?!
1802255	Shillien… Shillien. Such is the name imprinted in my memory…

1802355	Rumors have it that Lindvior is headed this way.
1802356	Do you think he can be stopped?

2000036	Well, for starters, the Great Pirate Captain Uthanka - that's me - was the ruler of the very Talking Island you're standing on!
2000037	Back in those days, nobodies like you wouldn't have stood a chance against the likes of me.
2000038	Well, all that came to an end when Ye Sagira crashed onto the Talking Island because of Shillien's resurrection, so it's all done and past, I guess…
2000039	If it hadn't been for that, this island would have stayed under my great rule.
2000040	Ah, the good old days…
2000041	What, still here? You were actually listening?
2000042	Ahem, eh, well, thanks…
2000043	Well, since you stayed to hear my story, I can't let you leave empty-handed now, can I?
2000044	I'll give you a special gift. It's not for everyone, mind you! It's the most valuable thing in the history of Aden!
2000045	It's in your pouch, so use it well, you hear?
2000046	Man, I'm tired… I forgot how much talking can wear you out!
2000047	Only one ruler left! Let's finish this up!
2000048	Everyone watch out for ice shards when debuffing.
2000049	So sleepy… better finish this fast so I can go sleep!
2000050	Now, don't make yourself look stupid. Finish it clean.
2000051	Watch out for lags, and start! Go, go, go!
2000052	Man, that hurts like hell! Heal, give me a heal!
2000053	The buffs are out! Give me buffs!
2000054	Pattern 2 begun! Don't let the boss cast buffs!
2000055	This is the 3rd and final pattern. Focus your hits on the Crystal of Protection.
2000056	Hit the Crystal, hit it, hit it!
2000057	Heal! Heal! Heal me, come on!
2000058	Why am I the only one getting hit? Not fair!
2000059	What, a heal? Man, we just can't catch a break today!
2000060	Come on, let's hurry up and finish it off so we can go eat.
2000061	Why is the AI so good? Do they want us to beat this thing or not?
2000062	We will be faithful servants to our new ruler.
2000063	We humbly offer you this Chest of Offerings.
2000064	Shillien's shout: I will take that power from you!
2000065	Punitive creatures, die!
2000066	I'm the new ruler here!
2000067	Only death awaits those who refuse to serve Shillien.
2000068	Will Jermann be restored to what he used to be?
2000069	We must accept that only the mighty can survive! We must obtain power so that we can have our revenge on Shillien!
2000070	Seek the stone statue of Jermann the Great Leader for assistance, and you will be guided to the next step.
2000071	You will need to prepare skills that match your new power.
2000072	Well, I'll continue my story next time we meet. See ya.
2000073	Loyal Captain
2000074	I think this is as far as I can go in helping you, $s1. I will bow out now.
2000075	I want a slushie…oh, if only I could have a slushie…hey, if you bring me 10 of each ingredient, I'll make you a Summer Slushie!
2000076	I'll give you a Boss Accessory Pack if you bring me 15 Summer Slushies!
2000077	Well, howdy-do! Isn't my swimsuit the cutest thing ever? It's time for a tan, yes it is!
2000078	Thanks! I'll be counting on you next time too!
2000079	Oh come on… you have to bring me the right materials!
2000080	Aghh! Zombies! Zombies!
2000081	Ugh…please, someone get rid of these zombies…
2000082	I've been bitten by a zombie…someone help me…

2000084	Einhasad, dear goddess…please save us…
2000085	We have to protect the Crystal of Protection if we want to stop these blasted zombies.
2000086	Filthy creatures of Shillien… The town will fall into chaos if we don't stop the zombies.
2000087	I can't partake in the battle because I have to defend the Crystal of Protection. Please, someone stop these zombies.
2000088	Zombies have appeared at the outskirts of Gludio, and are coming this way.
2000089	Zombies have appeared at the outskirts of Aden, and are coming this way.
2000090	Zombies have appeared at the outskirts of Schuttgart, and are coming this way.

2000092	The age of chaos and darkness has come. I shall guide you to darkness.
2000093	I will make you invincible with the power of this plague.
2000094	Humans…so complacent and weak after years of peace. How about I let you spread the fear of pestilence unto them?
2000095	For the prosperity of my people, I will use my power on Jermann and Jermann only.  I cannot overpower my own people.
2000096	Are you ready to face your enemies?
2000097	You sense the presence of Pirate Captain Uthanka at the outskirts of Talking Island Village.

1802519	This place swarms with Dragons by day, and Undead by night.
1802520	Monsters appear here and there, confused by the Whirling Vortex.
1802521	Hey, that hurt! You just wait here, and I'll be back as a stronger dragon!
1802522	I'm going to transform with the power of the vortex! You just watch!
1802523	Read the Mysterious Letter in your inventory.
1802524	Now you can choose a subclass! Talk to Raina again.
1802525	You have reached Anghel Waterfall! Go inside the cave.
1802526	Use the Fondest Heart in your inventory.
1802527	Use the Fiercest Flame in your inventory.
1802528	Use the Brightest Light in your inventory.
1802529	Use the Purest Soul in your inventory.
1802530	Use the Clearest Water in your inventory.
1802531	Now you can choose a dual class! Talk to Raina in Talking Island Village for more details.
1802532	You will kneel to me!
1802533	The dead are calling…and I answer! 
1802534	Kill, all you cursed soldiers! Kill everything!
1802535	My wind barrier! How? Only the Ertheia can - wait - unless you are..?!

1803977	It’s the first time for a long while when I’m leaving mountains and coming down... oh, my poor bones, oh, my poor muscles. My back hurts... So, kids, are you really not interested to find out who I am?
1803978	Now you are full of energy and all is going perfect, am I right? Well, come closer then.
1803979	That’s what I’m going to tell you. Look at yourself! You can do everything! Go ahead, do not afraid hardships and troubles, you can deal with them because you are so young and strong! All challenges you encounter are going to be for your good.
1803980	Use the energy I gave you to enhance your equipment. All is going to be good if you are lucky enough.
1803981	I’m sorry... I don’t know how this energy works. I could use it after I had a prophetic dream.
1803982	Now, don’t be shy, use the energy on your equipment. Believe me, you can enhance your equipment only if you use my energy.
1803983	Eh? What? Hey, you have a talking equipment! What a magic! It cries aloud begging for enhancement... Or maybe not...
1803984	You cannot teleport outside of the Arena.
