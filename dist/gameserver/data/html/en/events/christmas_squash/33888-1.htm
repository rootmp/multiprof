Santa Claus:<br>
Snowy Young Squash and Snowy Large Young Squash need nectar for growth. If you double click on the seed, the squash sprouts. If you give her nectar, it begins to grow rapidly.<br>
When the squash absorbs enough nectar, it will grow, and it will need to be split.<br>
But we must remember some important things!<br>
If you start to beat an immature squash, it will wither. Be careful! In addition, the squash may disappear. Try to split it before this happens! Snowy Young Squashes (not sprouted) disappear <font color="LEVEL">after 3 minutes</font>, and Ripe - <font color="LEVEL">after 1 min. 30 seconds</font> after ripening!<br>
And yet, the Snowy Squash cannot be broken with ordinary weapons, you need to beat them with special weapons that make music! In addition, it is very difficult to break a large squash alone, so by all means call your friends! And the last thing: when you smash a squash, choose a flat place, because if objects fall, say, on a hill, you will not be able to pick them up!<br>
Do you understand everything?<br>
