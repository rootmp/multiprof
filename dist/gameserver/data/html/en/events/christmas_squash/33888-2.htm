Santa Claus:<br>
So, be careful: ordinary squashes, which can be split with ordinary weapons, mainly drop consumables, and much less often valuable rewards.<br>
To get a truly valuable item, team up with colleagues and try splitting <font color="LEVEL">Snowy Large Squash</font> with a souvenir weapon!<br>
One last thing: when splitting snow squashes, you will receive from one to several awards. However, there is a possibility that the squash <font color="LEVEL">will be empty</font>. This applies to all types of squashes.<br>
