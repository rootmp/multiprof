A Talisman is an interesting mana item. When used on your wrist, it'll give you awesome results. However, you'll need to prove to me that you're worthy of such power. As a proof, give me <font color="LEVEL">10 Knight's Epaulettes</font> and I will reward you with a Fortress Talisman. Then, I can Exchange them for you.<br><br>
