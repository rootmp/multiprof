 I like your curiosity.<br>
So here's the deal:<br>
Each magical symbol forms a harmonious triangle of 3 stats.<br>
STR, DEX, and CON will form six forms of harmony, <br1>as will INT, MEN, and WIT.<br>
As you know, some symbols are class-specific while others aren't. And of course, advanced classes can use more advanced symbols!â€¨<br>
