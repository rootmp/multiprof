Gatekeeper Elisa<br>
Greetings! I am Elisa, a Gatekeeper of Ivory Tower. The tower represents the cultural, political, and religious center of Aden. Unfortunately, its visitors are only interested in fast teleporting to another place. I'm even a bit sad that they don't express enough interest in the Towerâ€¦<br>
