Hi there. The Dark Elf Guild is located on the 4th floor, the Elves of Light are on the 3rd, and the Human Mystics are downstairs. With a history stained by blood, don't you think it is encouraging to see the different races gathered in a small tower like this?<br>
Now, what can I do for you?<br>
<Button ALIGN=LEFT ICON="TELEPORT" action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_teleport_list_1">Go to another floor.</Button>
<Button ALIGN=LEFT ICON="QUEST" action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest</button>
