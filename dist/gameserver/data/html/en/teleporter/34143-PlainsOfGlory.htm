My name is Deton. I'm a traveling archaelogist. I'm 
always glad to give a helping hand to other travelers.<br>
Archaeology allows to learn new secret knowledge of 
ancient times. Thanks to my researches I've caught 
myself how to teleport. Using this new skill I can 
teleport you for free wherever you want to.<br>
Choose the place you want to travel. If you are going 
to teleport in the Dragon Valley, I'll give you a 
request.<br>
