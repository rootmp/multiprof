Of course, in order to create dual swords you need to have something to work with, a pair of swords.<br>
Also take into consideration that no artisan will work for free. They need to make their living after all... Running the forge isn't cheap either...<br>
Hmmâ€¦ There's something else... You need both swords to be well balanced, otherwise they won't make a good weapon. That's why you can only combine swords of the same grade.<br>
I work only with weapons of grades D and C. If you want something better, you should go to someplace bigger.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Also keep in mind that any weapon modifications will be lost in the fusion process.</font><br>
Any questions? Of course not, you know everything there is to know.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Also it is impossible to combine swords, if any one of them has a rune inserted.</font><br>
Well, choose the swords you want to get!<br>
