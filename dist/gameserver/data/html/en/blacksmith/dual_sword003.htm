I am sure, you see that you've came to a special place. I am a very experienced artisan.<br>
The thing is, it's not enough to master the making of dual swords. There is more to it. Since this weapon is one of the deadliest ones, its' production is limited.<br>
To make B-A grade dual swords you will need Dual Weapon Crafting Stamp, and to make S-grade dual swords you will need S-grade Dual Weapon Crafting Stamp.<br>
When you get this document bring it to me along with the swords you want to use for a Dual Sword weapon. And I will make a great weapon for you!<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Also, keep in mind that any weapon modifications will be lost in the fusion process.</font><br>
<font color="LEVEL">Also, it is impossible to fuse swords, if any of them bears a rune.</font><br>
<font color="LEVEL">And the last thing: S-grade dual swords are a very rare weapon, I cannot guarantee the result. The luck must be on your side to get them.</font><br>
<font color="LEVEL">S-grade dual swords can be made from modified S-grade weapon. But remember, if you fail the enchantment of the weapon will fall to zero.</font><br>
