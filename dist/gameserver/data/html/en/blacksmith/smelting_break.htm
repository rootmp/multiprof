You wish to remove the augmentation? That's fine. But understand that this augmenting method offers both improvement and potential penalties.<br>
It is difficult to restore the original weapon when removing the ability to augment. It requires a special chemical process and a special tool. It's also expensive.<br>
With that in mind, would you still like to remove it?<br>
