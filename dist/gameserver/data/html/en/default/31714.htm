Have you heard? Antharas has awakened, and Baium has become even stronger! It is a great opportunity for you to demonstrate your abilities to Balthus Knights. Do you have courage to face <font color="LEVEL">Baium</font>? Although our main target is Antharas, Baium must be defeated first. Kill him and receive Rash's supplies as a reward. Use them wisely!<br>
I can only teleport characters of <font color="LEVEL">level 70</font> and higher. <font color="LEVEL">I will teleport an alliance consisting of 27-300 members to any village of the leader's choice.</font><br>
