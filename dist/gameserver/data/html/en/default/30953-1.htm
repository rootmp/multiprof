Dimensional Vortex:<br>
The energy of Emperor Baium's Rage caused by his imprisioning crached the skies forming a rift. This rift leads to a new dimension. In order to get there, you will need a <font color=LEVEL>Celestial Shard</font>. You can extract it from the <font color=LEVEL>Unidentified Stone</font> after you kill all the monsters at the 6th floor or at higher floors of the Tower of Insolence.
