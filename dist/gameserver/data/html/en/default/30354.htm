Jewel:<br>
It's been hundreds of years since our people freed themselves from the curse of the Elves, but I still remember the pain of sunlight. For a long time we spent in the dark under the ground, coming to the surface only at night. <br>
Thanks to our Tetrarchs, we were able to destroy the curse and return what was rightfully ours. We still live in the Underground City, but one day, under the cover of night, we will start a war against Humans and Elves ... We will avenge ... <br>
We will never forgive our bright brothers who drove us out, and the People who mocked us ... But I still remember brothers dancing in the moonlight, enjoying music and poems ... Have we forgotten about the joys of life engulfed in anger and the thirst for revenge? <br>
