Freya:<br>

So you were decided to battle with King Ignis? How stupid...<br>

But if you have so much stupidity and courage I will help you and give you some power. If you <font color=LEVEL>won't stand against destructive fire power </font>, come to me. I will dispell the flame that eats flesh.
<br>

I can help you exactly five times, after that I will disappear for some time, to gather strength. While I'm away you will have to keep on your own. Xa-xa-xa!<br>
So your task depends on me too.
