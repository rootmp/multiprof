Support Troop Lieutenant Rash:<br>
I bow before your prowess. Oh, it looks like you fought with Baium. If you become even stronger, you will be ready for the battle with Antharas. Thanks to the Balthus Knights supplies, you will quickly develop your talents.<br>
And if you help us a little, you will receive the Balthus Knights Varnish as a reward.<br>
The chance of modifying a +8 Damaged Baium's Ring is higher than the chance of modifying a Damaged Antharas Earring. But this does not mean that your attempt will necessarily be successful. So be careful.<br>
