Maris:<br>
In the Giant's Cave, many of the treasures of the ancient Giants are hidden. It's dangerous here, but you can make good money. <br>
Not far from the entrance you can hunt alone, and in the depths of the cave it is better to go along with the comrades. I can send you to the center of the cave.<br>
