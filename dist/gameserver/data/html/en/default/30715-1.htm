You do not need to worry, but the Grand Magister Fairen on the 4th floor is very sensitive these days because he is having dreadful dreams lately, so be careful.<br>
Can you a imagine how a Dark Elf will act if he is actually 'sensitive?'<br>
Well, I think its because he had too much sunlight while he was at the rooftop.<br>
