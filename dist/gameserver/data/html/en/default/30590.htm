What brings you to these desert lands? My name is Roshik, I teach the Orcs their traditional Kawat martial art. <br>
God Paagrio teaches that the strongest in the world can only be achieved through endless work on oneself. I myself arrived here a month ago and am trying to become stronger through training, fasting and meditation. <br>
If you apply the strength of body and spirit to defeat frost and hunger, you can kindle the hot fire of a fighting spirit in your soul. Maybe you will join me? <br>
