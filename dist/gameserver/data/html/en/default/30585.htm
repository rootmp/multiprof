Tataru Zu Hestui:<br>
Tejakar Oroka! Greetings, young traveler. I am Tataru of the Hestui Tribe, one of the Shamans tasked with passing on the teachings of flame from the god Pa'agrio!<br>
Orcish magic uses the authority of the sacred flame to force spirits to do our bidding -- unlike those weak-willed Elves, who worship spirits as though they were gods, or those dim-witted Humans, who regard magic as science!<br>
