Antharas Watchman Theodric:<br>
I am Theodric, the Antharas Watchman. <br>
My calling is to watch Antharas, the accursed son of Shilen. I make sure he never wakes up, as that would put the whole world again on the brink of destruction. For the sake of my mission, I gave my soul to the Darkness and turned into undead.<br>
Previously the Antharas' Nest was hidden in deep caves, and it was not easy to get to it. But now Antharas has settled here, in the Dragon Valley. <br>
My mission has lost any meaning now, I don't need the Portal Stone anymore. And I don't know how to continue fulfilling my duty...<br>
