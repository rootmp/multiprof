Squashes grow by feeding them Squash Nectar! <font color="LEVEL">When you double-click the seed, a squash will grow, and when you pour nectar on it, it will grow more, meow!</font><br>
If it drinks enough nectar, the squash gets bigger. Then it divides into pieces when you hit it with a weapon, meow!<br>
But, there are some things to be cautious about, meow!<br>
First, if you hit the squash before it's fully grown, it will wither from malnutrition, so be careful, meow! And a squash always wants to run away, so make sure you smash it before it's gone, meow! A young squash that isn't fully grown runs away after 3 minutes, and a fully grown squash runs away after 1 minute and 30 seconds, meow! And a big squash cannot be divided into pieces with an ordinary weapon, meow! You have to smash it with a weapon called Chrono something or other, which plays music, meow! Also, it is difficult to divide the big squash by yourself. So, bring your friends, meow! Lastly, when you smash the squash, you must do it on flat land. Otherwise, it causes big trouble, meow!<br>
There are also genetically cloned squash seeds and big squash seeds, meow! Our master planted them on monsters as an experiment. The cloned seeds function the same as the others, but they can only be used by you, meow.<br>
Do you understand, meow?<br>
