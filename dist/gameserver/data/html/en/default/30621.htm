Master Nicolas: <br>
Hello! Have you decided to explore the Kruma Tower? Amazing place, right? They say it was built according to the drawings of the Giants. What secrets do its floors hold? Who knows ... Don't you really want to solve them? <br>
My name is Nicolas. I arrived here on behalf of the Black Anvil Guild. I need to explore this tower. But its corridors are teeming with terrible creatures. They didnâ€™t prepare me for this! Actually, I'm a scientist. I can write a report, do an experiment, fix something ... But fighting monsters is not my job! And where did the guy who the guild sent me as assistants stocked up on? <br>
