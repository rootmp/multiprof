Support Troop Lieutenant Rash:<br>
I bow before your prowess. You managed to drive Antharas far into his nest. The main goal is achieved.<br>
I will worthily reward you for this feat. I sell rare items needed by every Knight of Balthus. In my shop there is, for example, a Damaged Antharas Earring, which can be modified to +10 with the help of the Lac of the Order of Knights Baltus, and then exchanged for Antharas' Earring.<br>
