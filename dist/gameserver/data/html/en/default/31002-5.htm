Master Reorin: <br>
<Font color = "LEVEL"> Death Lord Hallett came to me </font> The head of the army of darkness, which is also called the Arrogant Invader or the Main Enemy of the Angels. He made me such an offer, which I could not refuse. All my life I dreamed of creating a masterpiece that will remain in history, and he promised to give me such a chance. I didn’t listen to my wife and made an agreement with Hallet ... And in the end I fell into his trap ... <br>
And my sin fell on the shoulders of Reyria’s wife ... (crying) <br>
My remorse will not change anything! I don’t want to talk about this anymore! .. (sobbing) <br>
Go away! <br>
