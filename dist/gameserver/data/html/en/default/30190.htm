Magister Phanovia:<br>
Welcome, young seeker of knowledge. I am Magister Phanovia.<br>
Did you have any difficulties finding us? We taught under the roof of the Temple of Einhasad for many years now. If you're looking for Grand Magister Valleria and others of her school, they teach over at the Ivory Tower.<br>
