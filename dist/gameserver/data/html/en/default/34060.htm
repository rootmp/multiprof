Primavera: <br>
Hello! My name is Primavera. I came to Aden to enjoy the spring warmth. <br>
I have prepared pleasant surprises for soldiers of level 40 and above, who are also happy about the arrival of spring! <br>
Time! <br>
Once a day I will give 5 effects of Saiha Spring Wind, which increases the experience bonus and SP under the protection of Saiha. <br>
Two! <br>
Also, once a day I will restore 140,000 Saiha patronage points. <br>
<br>
Hurry up! I will be in Aden from March 27 to April 17, 2019! <br>
Spring in Lineage 2 is waiting for you! <br>
