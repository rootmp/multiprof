<br>
Carsus My name, I am a member of the Guild of Explorers. I was recently sent to the Fortress Ivory. Study the top of the tower has been completed, and for the lower part of the study sent us here.<br>
We installed a lift to attack the tower through the most vulnerable spot - <font color="LEVEL">3rd floor of the dungeon</font>. Of course, it would be possible to go there by magic, but we would have attracted too much attention: lift much safer.<br>
By the way, with the help of the <font color="LEVEL">Ivory Tower Wizard Ian</font> You can enter to the 2nd floor where lives Raid Boss.
