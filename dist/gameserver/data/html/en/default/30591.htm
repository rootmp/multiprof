Glory to the Orkam! My name is Toruka, I train the Orcs in their traditional Kawat martial art. Kavat turns a warrior's body into a dangerous weapon. The orcs that own Kavat do not use swords or spears. In battle they use only the strength and speed of their body. <br>
God Paagrio teaches that the strongest in the world can only be achieved through endless work on oneself. I took the path of this teaching and, having rejected all worldly joys, I devote myself to training in this remote plain. <br>
