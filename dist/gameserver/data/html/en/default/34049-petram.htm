<html><head><body>Tritan:<br>Oh, so you are interested, huh? When I was a child I read an old book about Earth Spirit King <font color="LEVEL">Petram</font>. But I have always thought that this Petram was a tall tale. And then the spirits invaded the place and I had to investigate to learn the cause for that. And just imagine how surprised I was when I discovered that Petram was real!<br>
He is huge! His body is like a rock and his fists are like giant boulders. What should I tell next? Hm... Ah, yes! It was written in that old book that <font color="LEVEL">the stones covering the body of Earth Spirit King make him almost invincible</font>.<br>
And if you're not afraid of challenges, you can fight this monster at the extreme difficulty level.<br1>
(<font color="LEVEL">For Command Channels of 27 and more characters.</font>, however, only character of Lv. 80 and higher are allowed to fight at the extreme difficulty level.)<br>
