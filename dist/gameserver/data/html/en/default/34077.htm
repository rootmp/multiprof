Jensen:<br>
We were sailing, everything quiet as usual, when the sky suddenly darkened and waves started picking up... I woke up in a damp cave, if I can even call it that. I noticed construction materials and could tell that someone had been working with tools.<br>
And that's when I caught sight of sinister eyes peering at me from the darkness. They couldn't belong to a sentient creature. No, the place was teeming with monsters!<br>
I got away, though it wasn't easy, and it took everything I had to get to Aden. I have to get some rest.
