Master Svein:<br>
In order to upgrade your Spirit, you will need attribute 
experience points that are obtained by killing 
elemental monsters.<br> 
Elemental monsters can be found everywhere around 
the world. You can see the monster's attribute when 
you choose it as a target.<br>
Every hunting zone has monsters of a certain 
attribute. You should always remember it if you want 
to grow your Spirit.<br>
