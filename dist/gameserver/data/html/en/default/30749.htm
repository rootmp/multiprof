Drake Zuov: <br>
La la la ... How do I like to swim! <br>
...? Are you the first time you see Drake who likes to swim? What is so unusual about this? Do not look like this, you are embarrassing me! Eh ... Perhaps the next time you have to swim somewhere away. For example, in the Rainbow Lake ... Previously, the two-legged could not cross the local mountains, but for the Drakes this is not an obstacle. But once you get here, it means that others will appear soon. Need to look for a quieter place. <br>
