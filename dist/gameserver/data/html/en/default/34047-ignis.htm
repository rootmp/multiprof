<html><head><body>Tara:<br>The place I discovered didn't suit the lay of the land here, but it was full of the Energy of Fire. There was an enormous being enveloped in flames above the head of a woman, his expression read as if he was imprisoned. I knew at once it was the Fire Spirit King, <font color="LEVEL">King Ignis</font>.<br>But the strange thing is the <font color="LEVEL">Ice Queen Freya</font> is also there. Why she does she dwell in a place full of the Energy of Fire? More importantly, King Ignis hides from the world and gathers his strength there. If he comes out into the world, the continent of Aden will fall into chaos. The strength of King Ignis must be quelled before then, no matter the cost! <br>You can also test your skills in the even harder challenge, the Epic Battle.<br1>
(<font color="LEVEL">An alliance of at least 27</font> may enter. To participate in the Epic Battle, you must be <font color="LEVEL">above Lv. 80</font>.<br>
