Adjutant Support Lash: <br>
I bow before your prowess. Oh, it looks like you fought Zaken. If you become even stronger, you will be ready for the battle with Antharas. Thanks to the Order of the Knights of Baltus, you will quickly develop your talents. <br>
And if you help us a little, you will receive the Order of the Knights of Baltus as a reward for the Lac. <br>
The chance of modifying a Damaged Zaken Ring is +8 higher than the chance of modifying a Damaged Antharas Earring. But this does not mean that your attempt will necessarily be successful. So be careful. <br>
