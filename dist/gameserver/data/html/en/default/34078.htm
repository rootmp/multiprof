Aaah... I will never forget it! I want to find those creatures and kill them all.<br>
If only I had some Holy Water on me then, I could've slaughtered them all. But I have to use it so sparingly now after the disaster.<br>

I need to recover my strength and take out those monsters as soon as possible.
