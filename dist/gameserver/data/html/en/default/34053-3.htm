Master Svein:<br>
Attributes influence over the player's combat 
characteristics and protection.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">[Types of Attributes]</font><br>
Spirits are bound to the four general attributes which 
have brought them to life: water, fire, wind and earth.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">[Attribute Attack]</font><br>
If a character is attacking an ordinary monster with 
attribute power, inflicted damage is greatly 
increased. If a character is attacking an elemental 
monster, inflicted damage will be depending on the 
attribute of that monster.<br>
The <font color="LEVEL">effect of opposite attributes</font> becomes apparent 
when two attributes encounter each other and one of 
them is weak while the other is strong. If you use the 
strong attribute versus the weak one, the full blast 
damage will be 130%. If you use the weak attribute 
versus the strong one, the full blast damage will be 
10%. Attribute attacks let you deal more damage. 
You will deal maximum damage if you attack 
monsters of opposite attribute.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Correlation of opposite attributes</font> describes how 
attributes influence each other. Water is stronger 
than fire, fire is stronger than wind, wind is stronger 
than earth and earth is stronger than water.<br>
Power of one attribute depends on others', that's why 
it's important to master all the attributes.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">[Attribute Resistance]</font>
The best attribute for your protection is the attribute
damaging your character.<br>
So learning different attributes will help yourself in 
combat.<br>
