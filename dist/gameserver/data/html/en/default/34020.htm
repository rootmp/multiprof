Devil's Isle Agent Nikia:<br>
Hello! This is the Devil's Island. Here, at the entrance to this huge island, like a labyrinth, is almost safe. And in the depths of the island, they say, just an incredible amount of bloodthirsty monsters that are patiently waiting for fresh travelers!<br>
But I myself have not gone so far there... Therefore, I can not confirm or deny these rumors! You can not even ask me about all this. I just do not know what's really going on there.<br>
