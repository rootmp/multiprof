Northwind:<br>
This is a long story of two lovers. Once a man discovered that he was infected with an incurable disease. Even magic did not help. Instead of telling his beloved, he pretended to be angry with her and pushed her away. <br>
A year later, both died: he was from an illness, and she was due to a broken heart. Fate can be very merciless, isn't it?
