I work near the Tower, but every time I look at it, it takes my breath away. Oren Ivory Tower ... This is truly a magnificent building. It looks like a beautiful porcelain vase ... If you accidentally hurt it, it will break ... <br>
You probably do not understand. The fact is that the Tower is very beautiful, but also extremely unstable. Any Dwarf who knows a little about construction knows that. The tower is held only by magical power. When this power runs out ... This beautiful building will fall apart. <br>
