Master Reorin: <br>
Ahem! Are you lost? Well, the travelers have gone! <br>
Ahem! Look west ... there is the city of Oren ... <br>
Do you see a big fortress north of here? This is Oren Castle ... Ahem! <br>
If you leave the castle, cross the river and move further north ... You will find yourself in the main tower of magicians - the Ivory Tower. <br>
