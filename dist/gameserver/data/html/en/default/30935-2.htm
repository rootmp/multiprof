Collector Trumpin: <br>
My sister’s name is Marsha, she’s a collector like me. She is energetic and cheerful, but not very diligent. Prefers to solve cases in the easiest way. But actually she’s good. He always says what he thinks. It’s enough to talk to her, and immediately it becomes clear what her character is. <br>
At first we worked together, but we had to split up to hide from monsters. She should be somewhere nearby. If you see her, let me know that I'm worried. <br>
