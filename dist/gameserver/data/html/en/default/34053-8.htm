Master Svein:<br>
There's one more important thing - <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Ore</font>.<br>
Not long ago you could get it with no trouble in 
hunting zones, but now it's a very rare material.<br>
The ore is imbued with attributes. Consuming the ore, 
Spirit gets energy required for growing.<br>
If you have Spirit Ore, use it. In the Spirits menu, click 
on the Consume tab and then give the ore to your 
Spirit.<br>
