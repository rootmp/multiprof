Sir Aron Tanford: <br>
This road is an important trade route leading to Gludin Village and Port Giran. I protect travelers and merchants from the attacks of orcs and dinosaurs. <br>
Sorry, forgot to introduce myself. My name is Aron Tanford. I am the knight of Gludio and the Warden of the Wasteland. My responsibility is to ensure that civilians are not bothered by dangerous monsters. <br>
