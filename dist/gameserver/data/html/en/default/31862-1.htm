Angel Whirlwind: <br>
It happened a long time ago ... The powerful ruler wished to receive the gift of immortality from the Gods. He ordered the construction of a huge tower up to heaven to climb to its top and speak with the Gods. However, the Gods were angry with the ruler. They gave him the immortality that he so desired, but turned it into a monster and imprisoned it on the top floor of the tower .. <br>
... This stone sculpture is in fact Baium - the owner of the tower and the last emperor of Elmoreden. <br>
Immobilized by the will of the Gods, he can briefly return to life with the help of those who long for his strength. However, the Angels who guard him will also wake up from this dream ... <br>
Those who though gain the power of Bayum must battle the angry Angels. Angels hate both Bayum and those who dare to awaken him ... Bayum himself also has hatred for both Angels and strangers who want to take possession of his power. <font color = "LEVEL"> Remember that those who want to win this battle will have to defeat both the Angels and Bayum. </font> Only the strongest warriors will survive who will receive the strength and treasures of Bayum. <br>
