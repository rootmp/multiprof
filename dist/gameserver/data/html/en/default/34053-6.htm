Master Svein:<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Characteristics</font> are unique spirit abilities that differ 
them from each other. When your Spirit levels up, you 
get <font color="LEVEL">Characteristics Points</font>, which can be used for 
characteristics upgrading.<br>
The upgrading helps you to improve Spirit's 
characteristics to maximum.<br>
Don't worry, you can reset the progress and start it 
a new at any time.<br>
