Sora:<br>
I was able to find the room. There was a nasty-looking Steward keeping an eye on it who had the keys.<br>
Inside I met Goldberg, an Ancient Pirate Captain. He looked terrifying, just like pirate captains from fairytales. Defeating him by yourself will be hard. <br>
If you get Goldberg's Room Key from the Steward, I can send you there.<br>
