<br>Welcome!<br><br>
You want me to do an Augmentation?<br>
But do you have a Life Stone and Gemstones?<br>
Excellent. But remember that the results of Augmentation are completely unpredictable. So think it over properly.<br><br>
Ha! To <font color="LEVEL">augment an already augmented item you need to remove the spell from it first</font>.<br><br>
<Button ALIGN=LEFT ICON="NORMAL" action="bypass -h npc?Augment 1">Put the item on the anvil</Button><br>
<Button ALIGN=LEFT ICON="NORMAL" action="bypass -h npc?Augment 2">Cancel Augmentation</Button>
