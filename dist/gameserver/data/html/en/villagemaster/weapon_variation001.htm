Do you want to add special properties to your weapon? Good! Let's start enchanting then. Don't worry! Special properties do not depend on enchantments and do not affect it.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Our blacksmiths will help you insert a Rune into your weapon</font> if it has a necessary slot.<br>
You just need to choose a wepon and a rune to be inserted!<br>
By the way, if you have many unnecessary runes, give them to me, and I'll exchange them for other ones. Though of course I can't say what you'll get in return.<br>
But why not try your luck? Our life is a gamble, after all.<br>
