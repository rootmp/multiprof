Elemental Summoners are the Elven equivalent of Human Warlocks and Dark Elven Phantom Summoners. Elemental Summoners go hunting alone with the creatures they have summoned. They may either attack simultaneously or in support of one another. They may summon as many creatures as are necessary for any situation. <br>
To be an Elemental Summoner, your level must be over 40 and you must collect the Mark of the Scholar, the Mark of Life, and the Mark of the Summoner.<br>
