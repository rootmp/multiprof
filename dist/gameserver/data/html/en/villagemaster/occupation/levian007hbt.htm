High Priestess Levian:<br>
To become a Cleric, one's faith must be verified. I always leave the judgment in this matter in the hands of <font color="LEVEL">Priest Zigaunt,</font> who has devout faith. I suggest you speak to Priest Zigaunt here in our temple. To change profession to Cleric, you must pass his test and bring back the <font color="LEVEL">Mark of Faith</font> as proof.<br>
