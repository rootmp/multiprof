Elders practice both healing and supplementary magic. Elders do not specialize in one particular skill and thus are quite useful during small party play.<br>
They increase defense and evasion and are capable of healing allies and inflicting strong damage on the undead.<br>
To be an Elder, your level must be over 40 and you must collect the Mark of the Pilgrim, the Mark of Life, and the Mark of the Healer.<br>
