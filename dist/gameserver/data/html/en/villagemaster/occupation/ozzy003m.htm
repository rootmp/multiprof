A change of profession occurs when someone with the required abilities and experience is promoted to a more advanced profession. I'm afraid you cannot change your profession here. However, I can give you some information. An Elven Mystic like yourself can change profession to become an <font color="LEVEL">Elven Wizard</font>, who practices elemental magic, or an <font color="LEVEL">Elven Oracle</font>, who studies divine power. Which profession do you wish to know about?<br>
