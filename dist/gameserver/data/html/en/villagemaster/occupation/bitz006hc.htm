Grand Master Bitz:<br>
The <font color="LEVEL">Rogue</font> is the most unique among the three professions. They choose agility over the Warrior's power, and profit over the Knight's honor. They are armed with small daggers and bows and arrows, and can scout enemy camps without making any sound. Their abilities can make a great difference in battle. Rogues can later change to higher-level professions, like the <font color="LEVEL">Hawkeye</font>, who specializes in archery, or the <font color="LEVEL">Treasure Hunter</font>, whose primary weapon is the dagger.<br>
