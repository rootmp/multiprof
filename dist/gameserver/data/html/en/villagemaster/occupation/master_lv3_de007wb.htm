The Phantom Summoner usually hunts alone and fights cooperatively with the creature(s) he has summoned. It is important that enough creatures be summoned depending on the situation. His summoning skills and magic attack make him useful to a party.  <br>
To be a Phantom Summoner, your level must be over 40 and you must collect the Mark of the Scholar, the Mark of Fate, and the Mark of the Summoner.<br>
