Generally, from a fighter's point of view, a Treasure Hunter is designated as a special "Dagger Wielding" Rogue. The Treasure Hunter's battle style or role in party play is thus identical to that of a Rogue equipped with a dagger. During a siege, Treasure Hunters basically act as assassins in special situations. When a targeted opponent appears, the Rogue can raise his evasion and speed levels to dispose of a fleeing enemy.<br>
He possesses dagger skills, skills to strengthen the use of armor and a chance attack skill that inflicts enormous damage.<br>
To become a Treasure Hunter, you must at least be at level 40, and you must obtain the Mark of Seeker, the Mark of Trust and Mark of the Searcher.<br>
