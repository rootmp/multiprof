Grand Master Tronix: <br>
<font color="LEVEL"> Dark Wizards</font> command much more powerful spirits than Dark Mages and also use more powerful Elemental, Dark and Summon Magic. They ruthlessly attack their enemies by issuing commands.  They're also capable of summoning spirits known as Servitors.  <br>
The most elite Dark Wizards go on to become <font color="LEVEL">Spellhowlers</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Phantom Summoners</font>. <br>
Anyone wishing to become a Dark Wizard must pass the appropriate test and bring me the Jewel of Darkness as proof. <br>
