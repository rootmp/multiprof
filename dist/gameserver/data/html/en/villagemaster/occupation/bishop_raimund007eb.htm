High Priest Raymond:<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Oracles</font> utilize light, life and Spirits of Purification derived from Eva and Einhasad. These Priests provide spiritual advice to other Elves, using their great power to protect and heal rather than to harm. Those among the Oracles whose spiritual qualities are particularly outstanding can rise to the level of <font color="LEVEL"> Elder</font>. Blessed by Einhasad and Eva, Elders are eligible to use the highest levels of White Magic.<br>
To become an Oracle, you must pass a test and bring back a <font color="LEVEL">Leaf of Oracle</font> as proof.<br>
