If Shillien Knights are similar to Palus Knights, with a focus on defense, a Bladedancer is the opposite.  Their defense skills are the weakest among Knights. They are strongest during party play or sieges, increasing hit rate, using their skills of dance and other Supplementary Magic. They are useful with double blades, magic skills and poisons, but their skills lag behind the Shillien Knights.<br>
To be a Bladedancer, your level must be over 40 and you must collect the Mark of the Challenger, the Mark of Fate, and the Mark of the Duelist.<br>
