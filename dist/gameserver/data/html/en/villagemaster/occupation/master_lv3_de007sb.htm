The basic style of the Phantom Rangers is very similar to the Human Hawkeyes or Elven Silver Rangers. However, their dodging and accuracy is much greater than that of Humans, due to their unique features. Though somewhat physically weak, they are much more aggressive. They're considered one of the most gifted masters of the Siege. When they attack in groups, even Paladins find it difficult to withstand their attack. <br>
They concentrate on mastering the Bow, and are capable of raining down a shower of arrows on unsuspecting enemies.<br>
Only those of level 40 or above can become Phantom Rangers. They must collect and present the Mark of the Searcher.<br>
