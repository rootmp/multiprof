High Priest Sylvain:<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Oracles</font> utilize light, life and Spirits of Purification derived from Eva and Einhasad. These Priests advise their Elven comrades and use their magic to protect and heal both themselves and others.<br>
Exceptionally gifted Oracles may become <font color="LEVEL">Elders</font> who, blessed by Einhasad and Eva, are able to use the most powerful white magic.<br>
To become an Oracle, you must pass the Oracle test and return with a <font color="LEVEL">Leaf of Oracle</font> as a proof.<br>
