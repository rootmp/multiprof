The Shillien Knight focuses on strategies of offense and defense, much like the Knights of other races. Their defensive skills are exemplary. Perhaps their most valuable skill, however, is their ability to summon Cubics. <br>
Cubics use Black Magic, strengthen equipment, and will poison, slow down, and drain the energy of opponents.  <br>
To be a Shillien Knight, your level must be over 40 and you must collect the Mark of Duty, the Mark of Fate and the Mark of Witchcraft.<br>
