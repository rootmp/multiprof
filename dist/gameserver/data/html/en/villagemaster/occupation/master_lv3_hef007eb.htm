Sword Singers use their skill of dance and supplementary magic to assist their parties during siege or clan war.  Weak defensively, their "Sword Singing" restores party members' HP, recreases evasion and speed of movement.  <br>
To be a Sword Singer, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of the Challenger, the Mark of Life, and the Mark of the Duelist.<br>
