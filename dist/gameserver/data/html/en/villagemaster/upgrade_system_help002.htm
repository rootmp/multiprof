You can upgrade rare or common weapon, armor, and accessories. Well, you can upgrade only enchanted items, though. Also you will need special materials.<br1>
You can upgrade common weapons starting from <font color="00FFFF">+12</font>, common armor can be upgraded starting from <font color="00FFFF">+10</font>, common accessories - starting from <font color="00FFFF">+8</font>. These rules do not apply to rare items.<br>
Success rate for an upgrade depends on the type of item. There can be unseuccessful tries. So, be careful. Remember that you can't upgrade augmented items or items with runes.<br>
If you upgrade common armor, you can use only sealed grade-B and higher gloves/ boots/ helmets.<br>
And one more thing. If you upgrade common armor to special, the items will be sealed.<br>
