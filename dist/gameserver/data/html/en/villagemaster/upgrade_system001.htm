Have you ever heard about Spirit Crystals? People find those quite often in Aden lately. As some elders and blacksmiths say, those crystals have the power to upgrade items.<br>
One of the elders, who had used such crystal, taught me to use this power. So I can help you to upgrade your items!<br>
Different materials are needed for an upgrade depending on the type and level of the item.<br>
