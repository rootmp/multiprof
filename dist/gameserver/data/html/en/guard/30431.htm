Sentinel Eriel:
<br>
Yes, bring the wind whispers peace to your soul. My name is Eriel. I refuse to accept peace with the Dark Elves, and therefore volunteered to guard the neutral zone and ensure that they are not penetrated into our forests.<br>
Incidentally, the neutral zone is located directly behind this bridge. And if you go further south, you will find yourself in <font color="LEVEL">Town of Gludio</font>. It is near to the Elves human settlements.<br>
