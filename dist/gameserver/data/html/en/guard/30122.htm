Guard Bane:<br>
Everything is clear! Welcome. I am Bane, a guard here in the Town of Giran. You can find many goods here that you can't find anywhere else. And if you're lucky, you may get your hands on some truly rare items. I went and had a look myself, but there was no way I could afford them with my wages. It's a shop called the Luxury Boutique... Do have a look, if you get a chance.<br>
