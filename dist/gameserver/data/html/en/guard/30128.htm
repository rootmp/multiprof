I sometimes talk with my friend Reikin about what the <font color="LEVEL">water dragon Fafurion</font> would look like. It's truly hard to imagine that Fafurion lives in Innadril Lake, just east from here. If that dragon ever ventured upon our village, complete annihilation would only be a matter of time, don't you think?<br>
