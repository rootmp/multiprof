Guard Vesa:<br>
If you cross the <font color="LEVEL">Death Pass</font> in the north and continue on for a while, you will reach <font color="LEVEL">Oren Territory</font>. I'm from there as well, but because of the war with Elmore they are strictly restricting the coming and going of ordinary people. I'm worried if my family there is safe.<br>
