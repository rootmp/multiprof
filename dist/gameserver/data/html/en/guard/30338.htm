Guard Melville:<br>
Welcome! I welcome you to the best town in the whole of the kingdom. Our town was ravaged severely during the war and left devastated, but the efforts of our lord restored the town almost completely and people have regained their vitality as well.<br>
Well, I wish you a good time in the town until you leave! And don't cause any trouble!<br>
