Guard Toma:<br>
Our captain is a bit, um, too formal. He says we must be attired properly to stand guard in front of the lord's castle! I don't think someone as lofty as a lord would care what a lowly guard wears, you know....<br>
Don't you think so? Is there really a need to tell people off because of something they wear? They do say what matters most is substance and not appearance, but... But if they do the same thing, wouldn't everyone want to wear things that look better?<br>
