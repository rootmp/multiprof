Guard Atanas:<br>
You've never heard of the blue dragon, Fafurion? Why, he's almost as strong as the green dragon Antharas, who's supposed to be horrible! I hear he's somewhere on the bottom of Lake Innadril. We're beset by dragons, here, on every side! I mean, I've never seen them personally, but... it's scary!
