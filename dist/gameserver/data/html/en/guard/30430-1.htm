Guard Trionell:
<br>
Neutral Zone starts just behind this bridge. After the war between Light and Dark Elves, this area was declared neutral for the prevention of conflicts. For a long time it was a buffer zone.<br>
Since none of the parties does not extend to the area, and the forest is thick, all kinds of strange life forms, which can not be found anywhere else, gather here.
