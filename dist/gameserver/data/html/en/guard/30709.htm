Guard Norton:<br>
Welcome to Hunter's Village! Normally ruffians gather here, but recently I've been seeing more and more normal people like you around. I will ask you a favor though... please don't stir up any commotions.<br>
To the south of the Hunter's Village is <font color="LEVEL">Dragon Valley,</font> and over by Castle Giran, <font color="LEVEL">the Town of Giran</font> is situated.<br>
