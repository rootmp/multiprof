Captain Lucas:<br>
Welcome, young friend. Welcome to Dion! I am Lucas, I handle security for Dion. Is this your first visit? Well, this here is a quiet and law-abiding town. I don't tolerate anyone disturbing the peace!<br>
When you decide to move on, be warned that there's a passel of dangerous areas outside the town. You'd be well advised not to venture out alone. Now, you have a nice stay, ya hear!<br>
