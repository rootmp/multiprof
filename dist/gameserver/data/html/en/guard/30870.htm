Captain Kurtiz:<br>
Aden castle is surrounded by pillars built during the age of the giants - it's practically invulnerable. Hell, even if everyone in Elmore came to attack, we can defend this castle with... maybe 5000?<br>
Of course, we're only strong here as long as we're not infiltrated, and our mission is to find the people in the city who wish harm on it, and prevent others like them from entering the city.<br>
