Guard Curtis:<br>
If you are thinking of leaving the village, I give you one warning. Beyond that mountain in the south is a place called the <font color="LEVEL">Ruins of Despair</font>. It is an extremely dangerous place so try to stay far away from it. Of course, if you insist on going, I am not going to stop you...<br>
