Guard Moretti:<br>
Well met. Standing guard here all day may seem tedious to others, but I'm always happy as I can meet and exchange greetings with many travelers such as yourself. And while guarding this Eastern Gate, I often get to see Elves from the <font color="LEVEL">Elven Forest</font>. I'm used to them now, but they filled me with wonder when I saw them for the first time....<br>
