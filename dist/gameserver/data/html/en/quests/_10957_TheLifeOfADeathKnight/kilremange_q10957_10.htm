<html><body>Head Trainer Kilremange:<br><br>
I'm very kind. I'll grant you a special buff that will be 
very useful during your training. And in case you 
might forget what a <font color="LEVEL">Death Knight</font> looks like, 
I'll turn you into an <font color="LEVEL">Ultimate Death Knight</font>.<br><br>
When hunting, always keep track of your <font color="LEVEL">DP</font> value. 
You can check it under your MP bar. If it passes 100 
points, the <font color="LEVEL">Devastating Mind</font> effect will appear. Don't 
forget that <font color="LEVEL">it's connected to the Death Points</font>.<br><br>
Your training can be quite dangerous, so take a few 
<font color="LEVEL">HP Potions</font> with you and set them to <font color="LEVEL">auto-use</font>. By the 
way, take some Soulshots. If you happen to find a 
<font color="LEVEL">Soulshot Ticket</font>, you can exchange it for Spiritshots 
or Soulshots through the <font color="LEVEL">Game Assistant</font>.<br>
So, are you ready for your next training session?<br>
