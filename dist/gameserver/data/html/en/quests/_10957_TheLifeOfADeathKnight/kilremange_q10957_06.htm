Looks like you got attack down pat.<br><br>
Do you remember the Soulshots? You can use them to make attacks deal more damage.<br><br>
You might think that Soulshots are nigh useless, but 
they actually let you deal a lot of damage, so don't 
neglect them when you're fighting monsters or other enemies.<br>
