Good job learning the basic controls in the game. Now you are ready to begin your adventures. Take this gift. You know to use it, right?<br>
Go to <font color="LEVEL">Talking Island Village</font> and speak to the <font color="LEVEL">Newbie Guide</font> there. He will advise you about what to do next, as well as give you a useful gift. Then, leave now. Good luck!<br>
