Local people want to perform the rite of remembrance 
of dead warriors who faced their death in the Sel 
Mahum Base.<br><br>
But they can't do it now, too many monsters are 
wandering in that place.<br><br>
Go to the <font color="LEVEL">Orc Barracks</font> and kill monsters 
roaming there. Monsters to hunt: <font color="LEVEL">Turek Orc, 
Turek Orc Footman, Turek Orc Marksman, Turek Orc 
Warrior, Turek Orc Shaman, Kerr, Turek Orc Elite, 
Turek Orc Skirmisher, Turek Orc Sniper, Turek 
Orc Prefect, Turek Orc Elder, Turek</font>. You have to 
destroy <font color="LEVEL">1000 monsters</font>.
