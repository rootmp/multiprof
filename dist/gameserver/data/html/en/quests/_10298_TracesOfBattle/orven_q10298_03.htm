<html><body>High Priest Orven:<br><br>
Many warriors has died on the War-Torn Plains.<br><br>
Echoes of their sufferings and deaths had been 
imprinted in the plains for ever. That's why monsters 
like wandering there.<br><br>
So the War-Torn Plains is very dangerous place. But 
we can't leave it as is. I want to ask you for help.<br>
