<html><body>Master Kerkir:<br><br>
I think it's time you learned the special abilities of our kind and mastered the combat art of the Sylphs.<br><br>
Your task is to go to the <font color="LEVEL">Whispering Woods</font> and to kill 30 <font color="LEVEL">Volatu, Photoroni and Alesis</font> there.<br><br>
I have nothing else to teach you. Once you're finished with the task, talk to <font color="LEVEL">Grocer Evia</font>.<br><br>
Evia is not a simple merchant, though. She used to be a great warrior and earned the respect of our queen. That's why Evia was given a very important mission. She provides supplies for everyone in this settlement. I'm sure she'll be happy to teach you a few tricks.<br>
