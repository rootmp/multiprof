We have spent a long time isolated from the outside world and as a result we have grown quite different from its inhabitants. That's why, for example, we have a strong bond with elemental spirits.<br><br>
We have also created firearms that had not been known in this world yet. And we use the power of wind to float above ground when we fight.<br>
