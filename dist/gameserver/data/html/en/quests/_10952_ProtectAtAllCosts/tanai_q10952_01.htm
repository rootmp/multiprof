<html><body>Guardian Tanai:<br><br>
I am called the Guardian. Do you want to know what my duties are?<br>
I preserve our ancestors' souls.<br>
I must not let anyone disturb their burial places in the Valley of Heroes.<br>
Also, I am to tell young Orcs what they must do to protect our legacy.<br>
You should know that lately monsters in the Valley of Heroes have been digging our ancestors' graves, and it worries me greatly.
