<font color="LEVEL">Game Assistant</font> can <font color="LEVEL">exchange Soulshot Tickets</font> for Soulshots and Spiritshots. 
To do that, open the <font color="LEVEL">Items menu and look for Soulshots/ Spiritshots</font>. That's all I know about that.<br>
Huh? That is not what you're interested in...? My apologies! I'm so often asked about Soulshot Tickets, that I acted without thinking.<br><br>
Here, take these trinkets and Scrolls of Escape. They will come in handy.<br><br>
By the way, I've heard rumors that Captain Bathis in Gludio needs help with something... Are you interested?<br>
