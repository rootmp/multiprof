That's all I have to teach you.<br>
Oh, I've forgotten to tell you about <font color="LEVEL">Beast Points</font>! So, you will accumulate them with time.<br>
But let me show you how it looks in practice. See, I've recharged your BP reserves. Now open your <font color="LEVEL">skill window</font> and use the <font color="LEVEL">Blazing Beast</font> skill.<br>
When it is active, your moving skills become more efficient, and you can attack nearby enemies automatically.<br>
Beast Points are very important. Their bar is right below your HP, always keep an eye on it.<br>
And now go to <font color="LEVEL">Guardian Tanai</font>.<br>
He has a lot to teach you.
