The main thing about Soulshots is to have them always at your disposal.<br>
You don't have any in your inventory, right? Then I'll give you some.<br>
Soulshots are equipped automatically when you start using a weapon.<br>
Also, you can come across Spiritshots - these are like Soulshots but they increase your magic powers instead of fighting abilities.<br>
Well, why don't you test these Soulshots yourself? Use them to attack Training Dummies.
