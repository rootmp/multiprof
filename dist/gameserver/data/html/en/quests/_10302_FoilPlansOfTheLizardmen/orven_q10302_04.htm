Local people want to perform the rite of remembrance 
of dead warriors who faced their death in the Plains 
of the Lizardmen.<br><br>
But they can't do it now, too many monsters are 
wandering in that place.<br><br>
Go to the <font color="LEVEL">Plains of the Lizardmen</font> and kill monsters 
roaming there. Monsters to hunt: <font color="LEVEL">Tanta 
Lizardman, Tanta Lizardman Warrior, Tanta Lizardman Berserker, 
Tanta Lizardman Archer, Tanta Lizardman Summoner</font>. You have to 
destroy <font color="LEVEL">1000 monsters</font>.
