Nothing special, a few jewels and a Scroll of Escape. I have some advice for you. If you have a <font color="LEVEL">Soulshot Ticket</font>, 
you can <font color="LEVEL">exchange it</font> for Soulshots or Spiritshots through the <font color="LEVEL">Game Assistant</font>. 
To do so, open the <font color="LEVEL">Items menu and look there for Soulshots/ Spiritshots</font>. I hope you'll find this information useful.<br><br>
By the way, I've heard some talks that Captain Bathis in Gludio needs help with something... Are you interested?<br>
