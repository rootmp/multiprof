Thanks!<br><br>
<font color="LEVEL">Goblin Raiders, Goblin Thieves, Kaboo Orcs and Kaboo Orc Soldiers</font> are roaming near the village. 
You need to kill <font color="LEVEL">20 of these scoundrels</font>.<br><br>
If you decide to go, I'll show you the way. It's close, just around the entrance to the village.<br><br>
I can teleport you there, if you don't want to waste time. Pretty cool, huh?<br><br>
