Great!<br><br>
To the east of the village there is a place called <font color="LEVEL">Golden Hills</font>. There are rumors of gold deposits there, but we can't check these rumors at all, 
so there is no need to dwell on the name's origin.<br><br>
The most important thing for you right now is your task, and that is to hunt monsters that roam those hills. Kill <font color="LEVEL">Mountain Werewolves, Mountain Fungi, 
Muertos Fighters and Muertos Captains</font> - <font color="LEVEL">30 monsters in total</font>.<br><br>
I can teleport you there right now.<br><br>
