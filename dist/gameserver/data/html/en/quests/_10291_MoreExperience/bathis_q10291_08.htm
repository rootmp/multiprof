You've done great! By the way, if you have an <font color="LEVEL">XP Scroll</font> 
in <font color="LEVEL">your inventory</font> don't hesitate to use it.<br>
One more thing! I have to tell you about the <font color="LEVEL">Scroll: 
Enchant Aden Weapon</font>. I've prepared a <font color="LEVEL">Scroll: 
Enchant Aden Weapon</font> for you, you can use it to 
enchant an <font color="LEVEL">Aden Weapon</font>.<br><br>
Also I have a special present for you.<br><br>
That's jewel fragments. I'd love to give you a whole 
jewel as they grand their owners amazing abilities, 
but the fragments will do for now. You should 
probably try to find a few whole ones for yourself to 
experience their astounding power first-hand.<br><br>
If you want I can tell you more about jewels and 
compounding. Are you interested?<br>
