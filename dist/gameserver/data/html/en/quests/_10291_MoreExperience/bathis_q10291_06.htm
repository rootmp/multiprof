If you want to get the best result, you shouldn't 
waste your time. At the same time, undue hurry can 
do a lot of harm. When you are practicing, you should 
do everything unhurriedly and presistently.<br><br>
I suppose the <font color="LEVEL">Abandoned Camp</font> is the best place for 
your training. If you're strong enough, you can deal 
with the creatures living there.<br><br>
You can get to the Abandoned Camp by using 
<font color="LEVEL">teleport</font>. The place can be found in the <font color="LEVEL">list of 
teleports</font> transfering to <font color="LEVEL">Gluding hunting zones</font>, so it's 
not a problem to get there.<br><br>
Good luck!
