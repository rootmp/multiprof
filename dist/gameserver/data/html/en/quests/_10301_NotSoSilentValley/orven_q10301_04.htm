That's right. A lot of creatures created by Giants are 
roaming there. Giant's legacy, if I may call them so.<br><br>
Long ago the Giants were their masters, but now the 
creatures serve nobody and nobody can keep them at 
bay. They have lost their memories and turned into 
monsters attacking anyone who doesn't look like a 
Giant.<br><br>
If we sit back and do nothing, these monsters will 
spread out over the world. So go to the <font color="LEVEL">Silent Valley</font> 
and kill <font color="LEVEL">1000 monsters</font> there. Please hunt down every 
<font color="LEVEL">Creature of the Past, Forgotten Face, Giant's Shadow, 
Warrior of Ancient Times, Shaman of Ancient Times, 
and Forgotten Ancient Creature</font> that you see.
