<html><body>High Priest Maximilian:<br><br>
You have to explore Death Pass. It's called like that 
not for nothing. Many brave warriors had met their 
deaths there. Another problem is that the Dragon 
Valley where dreadful Antharas lives neighbours 
upon the Death Pass.<br><br>
There's a rumour that Antharas has been acting in a 
strange way lately. We must be sure he is not 
controlling the monsters living in nearby areas.<br><br>
That's the reason why I'm asking you to go to the 
Death Pass. You have to kill the monsters inhabiting 
there and test the waters.
