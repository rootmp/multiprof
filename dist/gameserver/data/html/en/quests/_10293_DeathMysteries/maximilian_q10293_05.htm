Go to the Death Pass. There you must hunt <font color="LEVEL">Wyrms, 
Guardian Basilisks, Road Scavengers, Fettered Souls, 
Windsus and Grandis</font>.<br><br>
These monsters constantly emanate the energy of 
death, so we just can't let them be.<br><br>
The Death Pass is not far from here. You can go 
there by foot if you want, but you can also use a 
teleport.<br><br>
Go to Giran's Gatekeeper and find the Death Pass in 
her teleport list. Easy, eh?
