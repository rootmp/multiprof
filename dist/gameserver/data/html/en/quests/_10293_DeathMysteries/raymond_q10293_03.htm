This time the High Priest Maximilian is in need of 
your help. You can find him in the Temple of 
Einhasad in Giran.<br><br>
He has heard a lot about your achievements, that's 
why he wants to give you an assignment. But 
Maximilian supposed that you wouldn't listen to a 
stranger. So he asked me to tell you his plea.<br>
