Yes, that's right. I have to admit that I've heard a lot 
about your heroic deeds. So when strange things 
had started happening in the Gorgon Flower Garden, 
I thought about you and asked Raymond to arrange

It is very important. Otherwise, I wouldn't have asked 
that you leave Gludio in such a hurry.<br>
