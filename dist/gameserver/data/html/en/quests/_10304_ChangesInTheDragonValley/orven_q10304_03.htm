<html><body>High Priest Orven:<br><br>
Long ago there was a significant battle in the Dragon 
Valley.<br><br>
Soldiers of Empire hoping to capture the Devastated 
Castle sprayed a poison all over the field. So many 
brave warriors died in that day...<br><br>
The Dragon Valley have been haunted by evil 
spirits since then. Souls of the dead warriors have 
become possessed. They have no rest... We have to 
help them.<br>
