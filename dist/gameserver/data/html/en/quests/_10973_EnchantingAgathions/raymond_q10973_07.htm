Great! But you should know one more thing. 
Adventurer's Agathion - Griffin is an agathion for 
newbie adventurers, so it can be enchanted to +1 
only. Other agathions can become much stronger.<br><br>
However, when you enchant agathion to +4 and 
higher there is a chance to fail enchanting, in that 
case the agathion disappears.
