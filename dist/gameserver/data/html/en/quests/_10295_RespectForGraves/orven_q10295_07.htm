<html><body>High Priest Orven:<br><br>
One day you'll become a glorious warrior, no doubt.<br><br>
But you shouldn't let the grass grow under your feet. 
You have to fight worthy enemies to become stronger.<br><br>
Now I advise you to travel to the <font color="LEVEL">Fields of Massacre</font>.<br><br>
By the way, I have to tell you about <font color="LEVEL">craft points</font>. You 
can get them by killing monsters. When you collect 
the required amount, you can <font color="LEVEL">create a random item</font>. 
So make efforts.<br><br>
Also, there's one thing that can help you in crafting. 
It is called <font color="LEVEL">Asofe</font>. It increases the amount of craft 
points gained, so why don't you try it? May Einhasad 
bless you.
