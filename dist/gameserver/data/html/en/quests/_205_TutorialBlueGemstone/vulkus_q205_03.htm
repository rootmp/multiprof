Flame Guardian Vulkus:<br>
You worked hard, yet taught the basics of the game. Now you can go on a trip. I want to give you something. You probably already know how to use it?<br>
Now go to <font color="LEVEL">Orc Village</font> and find the <font color="LEVEL">Newbie Guide</font>. He will give you advice. And yet - useful items that will be useful when traveling.<br>
