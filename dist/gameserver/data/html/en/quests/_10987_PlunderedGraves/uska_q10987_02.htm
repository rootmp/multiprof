I've heard something interesting not so long ago. <font color="LEVEL">Game Assistant</font> can <font color="LEVEL">exchange Soulshot Tickets</font> 
for Soulshots and Spiritshots. To do that, open the <font color="LEVEL">Items menu and look for Soulshots/ Spiritshots</font>. 
I hope you'll find this information useful.<br>
Also they say that the Maraku werewolves are up to something.<br><br>
Their tribe is well-known for their shady deals, but now they're planning something really dangerous. As far as I know, 
Captain Bathis of Gludio is concerned about Maraku werewolves as well.<br><br>
Someone needs to kill these beasts and report to Bathis. So, are you up for the challenge?<br>
