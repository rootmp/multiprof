You do know that our ancestors are buried in the Valley of Heroes, right?<br><br>
Recently the valley's been crawling with <font color="LEVEL">Kasha Wolves, Kashe Forest Wolves, Goblin Tomb Raiders and Rakeclaw Imp Hunters</font>.<br><br>
We can't let them disturb our ancestors' rest. You can deal with them. Find Uska when you do it, and he will give you your reward.<br>
