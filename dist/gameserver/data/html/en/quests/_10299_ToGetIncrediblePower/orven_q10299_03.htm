Transcendent powers can be obtained only in special 
places.<br><br>
That places are called <font color="LEVEL">transcendent instance zones</font>.<br><br>
There are many different transcendent instance 
zones, so I'm sure you will find the one you like.<br><br>
If you get to the transcendent instance zone of your 
level, you'll see <font color="LEVEL">Grand Master</font> there. Speak to Grand 
Master to get ability to use transcendent power.<br>
