<html><body>High Priest Orven:<br><br>
You have to remember something <font color="LEVEL">very important</font>.<br><br>
As soon as you've spoken to Grand Master, <font color="LEVEL">many 
monsters appear</font>.<br><br>
Be ready to fight.<br><br>
Besides you have to remember that <font color="LEVEL">transcendent 
powers can be used only in transcendent instance 
zones</font>. If you leave the transcendent instance zone, 
you lose the powers.<br><br>
Go to the transcendent instance zone of your level 
and fight monsters dwelling there.<br><br>
It will make you stronger.<br>
