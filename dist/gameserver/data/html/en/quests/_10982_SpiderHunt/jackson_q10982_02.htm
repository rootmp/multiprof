Bathis said that he really appreciates warriors who have studied spiders and know how to dispatch them quickly. I think you can gain the necessary experience 
if you hunt spiders near Gludio.<br><br>
You will get the hang of it quickly. Kill <font color="LEVEL">30 spiders</font>, and you'll have the necessary experience. 
Spiders dwell to the west from here. It's pretty far if you go on foot.<br><br>
If you decide to go, I'll teleport you there.<br><br>
