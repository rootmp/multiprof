First of all, I will give you several Soulshots to try.<br>
They are used automatically when you have them in your inventory and have a weapon equipped.<br>
Also, you can come across Spiritshots - these are like Soulshots but they increase your magic powers instead of fighting abilities.<br>
Try using these Soulshots for yourself and see what they can do.<br>
Go ahead! Attack a Training Dummy once again, but this time use Soulshots.
