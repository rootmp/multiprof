Truth be told, there are hordes of monsters, and Ivory 
Tower Wizards cannot defeat them all. Try they to 
continue their explorations and researches, but they 
make little progress because monsters just don't stop 
attacking.<br>
I think you should go to the Cruma Tower and speak 
with the Ivory Tower Wizard named Carsus.<br>
Use a <font color="LEVEL">teleport</font> to get to the <font color="LEVEL">Cruma Tower</font>. You can 
find the nearest one in the teleport list of <font color="LEVEL">Dion hunting zones</font>.
