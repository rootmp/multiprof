<html><body>High Priest Orven:<br><br>
The Cruma Tower in the land of Dion is one of Giant's 
creations.<br>
Ivory Tower Wizards have a theory that Giants was 
planning to build an unique tower that would 
generate energy. But it's just a theory, there are not 
enough proofs, that's why the Cruma Tower is a 
study object.<br>
By the way, I think the wizards would be happy if 
someone helps them to explore the Cruma Tower.<br>
