Black Judge: <br>
Years are passing, I was once young and pure, just like you...<br>
I was a respective judge and have done my work perfectly...<br>
But greed overcame me. I started doing bad things. <br>
As far as I can see you started that path as well..the karma..oh the karma..<br>
I'm exciled now, and nobody wants me back. But I can help you! We can still save you!<br>
I can undo some of the sins that you have done! <br>
All you have to do is bring me 30 B grade gemstones and get our little friend, who is eating sins!<br>
Shall we start!<br>
