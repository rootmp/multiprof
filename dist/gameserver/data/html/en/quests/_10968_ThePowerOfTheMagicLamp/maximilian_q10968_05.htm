Interested in Magic Lamp? I have seen you 
examining it closely, so I was waiting that you come 
to me to speak about it.<br><br>
Magic Lamp capacity is 300 points. It can be filled 
during your hunt when you kill monsters and get 
experience. As soon as the lamp is filled, you can play 
the game. It's a pity it cannot be played whenever you 
want.<br><br>
But don't worry, if your lamp is empty - it's getting 
filled very fast!<br>
