To tell the truth, I myself have never seen it. But I 
know it can be obtained by adventurers while they 
are killing monsters.<br><br>
By doing that, you charge the Magic Lamp bar, and 
when it is full, you can play a game. By the way, is 
that a Magic Lantern in your hands?<br><br>
You can get XP and SP depending on the game 
results. Through I can be mistaken, because I rarely 
leave the temple, and my knowledge of the outside 
world is rather limited.<br><br>
In the old days you would get a Lantern after playing 
the game and then use it to gain XP and SP. But the 
Ivory Tower Wizards used Dwarven research to 
upgrade the technology and now you get XP and SP 
directly.<br>
