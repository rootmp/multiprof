I am very fascinated by the Magic Lamp and the way 
it grants XP and SP. It's a true miracle that resembles 
divine blessing. It makes me so sad to realise that I 
will never get to experience it myself... A capable 
warrior I am not.<br>
You, however, look more than worthy of this marvel. 
Why don't you charge the Magic Lamp bar and give 
the game a go once you have a chance?<br>
