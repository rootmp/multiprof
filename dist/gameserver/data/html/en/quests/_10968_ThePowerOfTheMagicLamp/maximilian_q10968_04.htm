Right! It's very easy to charge the Magic Lamp bar. It 
pretty much charges itself when you kill monsters 
and gain XP.<br>
The Magic Lamp games have four levels. Characters 
who have reached Lv. 76 can play the very best Magic 
Lamp games. If you are not that strong yet, I wish 
you luck with the first level game.<br>
In the meantime I will prepare a very useful gift for 
you. We'll talk again once we are done.<br>
