I have a special present for you. Look, it's <font color="LEVEL">Magic Fire</font>.<br><br>
I'm sure the item will come in handy, because it helps 
to fill the Magic Lamp faster.<br><br>
Oh, are you thinking about places, where you could 
fill the lamp?<br><br>
Well, your combat skills are sharpening very fast, 
that's why I think you are ready to go to new training 
grounds. That reminds me about one interesting 
story I have heard lately.<br>
