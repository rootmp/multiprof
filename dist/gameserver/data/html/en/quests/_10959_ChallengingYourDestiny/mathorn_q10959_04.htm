<html><body>Quartermaster Mathorn:<br><br>
You know it already. The best way to train is to battle 
monsters. It makes you body and spirit stronger and 
lets you overcome your fate.<br><br>
You have yet to understand it, though.<br><br>
Anyway, at this point your main goal is to become 
stronger. To do this, visit <font color="LEVEL">the second training 
grounds</font> and destroy <font color="LEVEL">Skeleton Scouts</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Skeleton 
Hunters</font> there. Bring eternal peace to these poor 
creatures who will never become Death Knights.<br><br>
If you're ready to go immediately, I can teleport you 
there.<br>
