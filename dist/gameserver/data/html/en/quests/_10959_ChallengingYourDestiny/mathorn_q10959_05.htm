Sometimes Death Knights bring eternal peace to 
restless creatures. This helps us come to terms with 
our own fate.<br><br>
Visit <font color="LEVEL">the second training grounds</font> and destroy 
<font color="LEVEL">Skeleton Scouts</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Skeleton Hunters</font> there. Bring 
eternal peace to these poor creatures who will never 
become Death Knights.<br>
If you're ready to go immediately, I can teleport you 
there.<br>
