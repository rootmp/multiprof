<html><body>High Priest Orven:<br><br>
There are too many monsters wandering on the 
Plains of Glory.<br><br>
But why am I surprised? Places of ancient battles are 
attracting monsters. Shattered lands are a some 
king of reminder of war horrors and a high price of 
victory.<br><br>
But the Plains of Glory is a special place for local 
people. We cannot allow monsters roaming there.<br><br>
Please, kill the monsters that are roaming the <font color="LEVEL">Plains 
of Glory</font>. I'm talking about <font color="LEVEL">Vanor Silenos, Vanor 
Silenos Soldier, Vanor Silenos Scout, Vanor Silenos 
Warrior, Vanor Silenos Shaman, Vanor Silenos 
Chieftain, Vanor, Mercenary of Glory</font>. You have to 
destroy <font color="LEVEL">500 monsters</font> in total.
