<html><body>High Priest Orven:<br><br>
If your equipment is good, go to the <font color="LEVEL">Sea of Spores</font> 
and practice your skills.<br><br>
To get to the Sea of Spores use a <font color="LEVEL">teleport</font>. The 
nearest one is placed in <font color="LEVEL">Oren</font>. Also you can use a 
<font color="LEVEL">scroll for teleporting to the Sea of Spores</font>. I know you 
have one in your inventory.<br><br>
By the way, monsters living in the Sea of Spores are 
bound to water attribute, so you'd better use <font color="LEVEL">wind 
attribute</font> against them. I hope it's useful information.
