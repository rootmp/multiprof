The Sea of Spores is surrounded by a special barrier 
that prevents its spreading.<br><br>
I would advise you to go there and practice your 
skills by fighting monsters. It will toughen you up 
before you go to other places.<br><br>
When you've gained enough experience and 
strength, I'll tell you where you should go next.<br>
