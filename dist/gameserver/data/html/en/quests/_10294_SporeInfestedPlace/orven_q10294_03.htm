<html><body>High Priest Orven:<br><br>
Yes... I know you are a brave and strong warrior who 
has provided their combat skills in many battles. People 
living in the places where you're farmed for your heroic 
deeds have spread news about it.<br><br>
You've achieved many victories but to get stronger 
you have to defeat more dangerous enemies in more 
dangerous places. I've in mind one such place.<br><br>
I'm talking about the <font color="LEVEL">Sea of Spores</font>. It's a very good 
place to improve your skills and grow stronger.<br><br>
You can get to the Sea of Spores using a <font color="LEVEL">teleport</font>, the 
nearest is in <font color="LEVEL">Oren</font>. I suppose a mighty warrior such 
as yourself can survive in this horrible place.<br>
