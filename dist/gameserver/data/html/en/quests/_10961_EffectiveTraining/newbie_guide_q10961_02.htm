To the south of the Kamael Village there is a place called the <font color="LEVEL">Hill of Hope</font>. There lies our first settlement in these lands. Many go there to honor the memory of our people.<br><br>
Go there to absorb the ancient power. It will help you start hunting monsters once again, though you haven't done it for a long time now.<br><br>
The Hill of Hope is inhabited by small and relatively calm animals. Hunt them to hone your rusted skills.<br><br>
Kill <font color="LEVEL">20 Grey Keltirs, Elder Grey Keltirs, Black Wolves and Elder Black Wolves</font>. Then come back to me.<br>
