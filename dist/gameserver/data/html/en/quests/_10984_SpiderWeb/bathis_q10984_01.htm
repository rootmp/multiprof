That's enough for now.<br><br>
What am I going to do? Unfortunately, I can't explain you all the details, but I have to say - there's no time to sit lazily when a lot of monsters 
is walking around. But nevermind, there is nothing to worry about.<br><br>
Here, take it. I want to express my gratitude so there is a gift for you.<br>
