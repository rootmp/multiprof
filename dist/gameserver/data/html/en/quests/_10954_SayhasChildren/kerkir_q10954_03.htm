First, you will need the Soulshots themselves. I'll give you a couple. Once you <font color="LEVEL">equip a weapon Soulshots are equipped automatically</font>.<br><br>
There also exist <font color="LEVEL">Spiritshots</font>, by the way. They make your magic more powerful.<br><br>
Attacks enhanced with Soulshots deal way more damage, you'll notice it immediately.<br><br>
Okay then. <font color="LEVEL">Equip Soulshots</font> and <font color="LEVEL">attack the Training Dummies again</font>.<br>
