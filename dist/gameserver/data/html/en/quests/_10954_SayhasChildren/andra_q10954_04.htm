First of all, you need to learn how to fight, otherwise you won't make it out there. This world is full of danger.<br><br>
And you can't fight if you don't know how to <font color="LEVEL">attack</font>.<br><br>
Randomly swinging your arms won't get you far, however. For a successful attack there needs to be a target. That's why I asked Master Kerkir to set up a few Training Dummies.<br><br>
I'll send you to the training ground. Once there, <font color="LEVEL">attack</font> a <font color="LEVEL">Training Dummy</font> to destroy it. Talk to <font color="LEVEL">Master Kerkir</font> once you're finished. He'll tell you what to do next.<br>
