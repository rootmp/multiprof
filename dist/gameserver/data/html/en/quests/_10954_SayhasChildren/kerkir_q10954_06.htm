So, pretty easy.<br><br>
Before we continue with your training I'll give you a buff. It'll enhance your abilities and make you slightly stronger.<br><br>
I also have Soulshots, in case you run out. If you need some in the future, <font color="LEVEL">Game Assistant</font> can exchange a <font color="LEVEL">Soulshot Ticket</font> for Soulshots and Spiritshots.<br><br>
One more thing! You can't use firearms, unless you have an <font color="LEVEL">Elemental Orb</font> in your <font color="LEVEL">inventory</font>. Keep that in mind.<br><br>
So, are you ready to continue your training?<br>
