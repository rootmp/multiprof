Good job learning the basic controls in the game. Now you are ready to begin your adventures. Take this gift. You know how to use it, right?<br>
Go to the <font color="LEVEL">Elven Village</font> and speak to the <font color="LEVEL">Newbie Guide</font> thene. He will advise you about what to do next, as well as give you a useful gift. Then, leave now. Good luck!<br>
