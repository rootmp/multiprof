There are Wolves and Bearded Keltirs wandering around the settlement.<br><br>
I can't work when they are around! Every time some food is send to the mine, the monsters move closer and begin growling. 
It's very scary! How can anyone work with such aggressive neighbors?<br><br>
Will you help me?<br><br>
And Gerald will definitely reward you for it.<br>
