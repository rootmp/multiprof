Local people want to perform the rite of remembrance 
of dead warriors who faced their death in the Dragon 
Valley.<br><br>
But they can't do it now, too many monsters are 
wandering in that place.<br><br>
Go to the <font color="LEVEL">Dragon Valley</font> and kill monsters 
roaming there. Monsters to hunt: <font color="LEVEL">Dragontroop Soldier, 
Dragontroop Lancer, Dragontroop Berserker, Dragontroop 
Minion, Dragontroop Wizard, Dragontroop Elite Wizard, 
Drake Minion, Mutated Drake</font>. You have to 
destroy <font color="LEVEL">1000 monsters</font>.
