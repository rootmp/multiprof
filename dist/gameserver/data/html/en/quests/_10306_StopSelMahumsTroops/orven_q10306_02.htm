<html><body>High Priest Orven:<br><br>
Long before our country was formed there was a 
great empire that was split into two kingdoms - 
Elmore and Aden fighting each other for owning more 
land. There were a lot of battles around the Aden 
Castle.<br><br>
Nevertheless Aden won, and the world changed. But 
even now you can see traces of that horrible war 
everywhere.<br>
