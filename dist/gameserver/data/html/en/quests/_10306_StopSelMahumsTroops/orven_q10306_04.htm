Local people want to perform the rite of remembrance 
of dead warriors who faced their death in the Sel 
Mahum Base.<br><br>
But they can't do it now, too many monsters are 
wandering in that place.<br><br>
Go to the <font color="LEVEL">Sel Mahum Base</font> and kill monsters 
roaming there. Monsters to hunt: <font color="LEVEL">Sel Mahum Sniper, 
Sel Mahum Raider, Sel Mahum Berserker, Sel Mahum Mage, 
Sel Mahum Thief, Sel Mahum Wizard, Sel Mahum Knight, 
Sel Mahum Footman, Sel Mahum Bowman</font>. You have to 
destroy <font color="LEVEL">1000 monsters</font>.
