Go to <font color="LEVEL">Immortal Plateau</font> to the south of Frozen Waterfalls. Defeat <font color="LEVEL">Maraku Werewolf Chieftains, 
Kasha Spiders, Kasha Blade Spiders and Evil Eye Patrols</font> roaming there.<br><br>
When the job is done, go to <font color="LEVEL">Captain Bathis</font> in <font color="LEVEL">Gludio</font>. 
He was looking for a warrior who can deal with Maraku Werewolves. I'm sure he will give you a reward.<br><br>
Well, are you ready? I think that slaying <font color="LEVEL">30 monsters</font> will be enough. Will you try?<br>
