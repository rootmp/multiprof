<html><body>Grocer Evia:<br><br>
Did you forget to choose a class? Do you really want to stay a simple Sylph Gunner when you can become a mighty Sharpshooter? Come on, change your class, don't waste any more time!<br><br>
After you've changed your class I'll send you to Bathis, the Captain of Gludio.<br><br>
Bathis is a natural born teacher. He doesn't discriminate and helps everyone regardless of their race.<br><br>
Before I left he asked to send other Sylphs his way if anyone else decided to explore the world. He said he would help them.<br><br>
That is a long and dangerous journey, though. You need to prepare really well if you decide to undertake it.<br>
