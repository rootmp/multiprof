Do you know how to use the <font color="LEVEL">map</font>?<br><br>
You can use it to learn more about your current location and the place you're going to. You can also see recommendations there.<br><br>
One more thing! We, the Gatekeepers, always ask adventurers about the places they've been to in order to create the recommendations. So you can trust us.<br><br>
So, are you ready to travel somewhere to try your new knowledge out?<br><br>
