Gludio Captain Bathis is looking for promising 
adventurers. As far as i know, he is tasked with 
teaching them and molding them into worthy 
warriors.<br><br>
The area around the city is perfect for training, so I 
think you should go there.<br><br>
Also, don't go to the city immediately, first show off 
you Death Knight skills and gain a reputation.<br>
