If you want to learn something useful, you can talk to 
<font color="LEVEL">Gatekeeper Marillia</font> at our base or go to <font color="LEVEL">Gludio</font> and 
talk to Gatekeeper Bella.<br><br>
They will be both very happy to help you. If you want I can sent you straight to Gludio's Gatekeeper.<br>
