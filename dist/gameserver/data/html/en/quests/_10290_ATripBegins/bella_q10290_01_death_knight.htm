<html><body>Gatekeeper Bella:<br><br>
You are a Death Knight? For real?<br><br>
Oh, sorry. I've heard that Death Knights stay away 
from our worldly affairs and dedicate themselves to 
some mysterious things, so I never thought I would 
see one in the flesh.<br><br>
It looks like you are ready to heed the call for adventure.<br><br>
As far as I know the Death Knight base has its own 
Gatekeeper but I guess you haven't met them.<br><br>
Well, you should learn to find suitable places to train then.<br>
