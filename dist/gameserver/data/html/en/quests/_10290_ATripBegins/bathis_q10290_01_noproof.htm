Training novices and turning them into real warriors is a very important job.<br><br>
For instance, look at you. You haven't changed your profession. If you've enough experience to change your profession you shouldn't dally it off.<br><br>
Of course, if you refuse flatly, nobody is going to insist. But changing of profession is providing benefits for you. You can change your profession 
easily just clicking on the special icon.<br><br>
Well, that's all. There's nothing more to know about profession changing. I hope you're not satisfied with what has been achieved 
and going to make progress further.<br><br>
