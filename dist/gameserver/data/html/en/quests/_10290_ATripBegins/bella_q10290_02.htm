So, first of all you need to know that the fastest and the most comfortable way to travel around the world is to use <font color="LEVEL">teleports</font>.<br><br>
To use a teleport just talk to a <font color="LEVEL">Gatekeeper</font> in any town. Or you can click the <font color="LEVEL">yellow windmill icon</font>.<br><br>
Thanks to teleports you can travel from one place to another very fast.<br><br>
What's more, you can use the <font color="LEVEL">Favorites</font> function to create a list of places you teleport to the most.<br><br>
