You want to know what's the best place to go to at 
your skill level is? Then go talk to the <font color="LEVEL">Gatekeeper</font>.<br><br>
We have one around. She was sent here to support 
the Death Knights. <font color="LEVEL">Go talk to her</font> then.<br><br>
You can talk to <font color="LEVEL">Gatekeeper Marillia</font> at our base or go 
to <font color="LEVEL">Gludio</font> and talk to Gatekeeper Bella.<br><br>
They will be both very happy to help you. If you want I can sent you straight to Gludio's Gatekeeper.<br>
