Well, if you know all the things let's get down to business.<br><br>
I've been holding the position for a good while, so I've met quite a number of adventurers who came to Gludio. I've watched carefully how they were getting stronger.<br><br>
Adventurers should find places where they feel equal to monsters inhabiting there and where their skills are going to be improved. Do you know how to do this?<br><br>
