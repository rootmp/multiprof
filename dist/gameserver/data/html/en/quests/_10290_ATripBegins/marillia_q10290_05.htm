Go to the <font color="LEVEL">Ruins of Agony</font>. You can get there using 
teleportation. To travel there select the <font color="LEVEL">teleport</font> to 
<font color="LEVEL">Gludio</font> from the <font color="LEVEL">list of hunting zone teleports</font>.<br><br>
The ruins are filled with monsters that threaten the 
city dwellers. I don't think you'd find them particularly 
dangerous. Show what you've learned and defeat the 
monsters.<br><br>
One more thing! When you defeat the monsters, don't 
go looking for me. Head straight to Gludio instead, to 
Captain Bathis.<br><br>
