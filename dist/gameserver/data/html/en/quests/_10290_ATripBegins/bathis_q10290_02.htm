Don't worry. I'll give you several advices. Follow them and you'll becoma an experienced adventurer really fast.<br><br>
First of all you have to learn some important and useful features that will help you in the nearest future. Press <font color="LEVEL">Tab</font> or 
<font color="LEVEL">Alt+V</font> to open your <font color="LEVEL">Inventory</font>.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Equip the weapons and armor</font> you need if you haven't done it already.<br>
You can open the <font color="LEVEL">Skill List</font> by pressing <font color="LEVEL">Alt+K</font>. If you changed class, you will see new skills that you can learn here as well. 
<font color="LEVEL">To learn skills you need to spend a certain amount of SP</font>. Also you learn new skills using <font color="LEVEL">Spellbooks</font> 
and <font color="LEVEL">Amulets</font>.<br>
Besides I recommend you become familiar with <font color="LEVEL">automatic hunting</font> option. But if you're sure you know all of the things, we can skip 
the tutorial and just go on.<br><br>
