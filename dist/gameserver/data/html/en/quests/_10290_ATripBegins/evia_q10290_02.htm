Bathis is the Captain of Gludio. Travellers from around the world come to him to learn useful things. I've met him, too.<br><br>
Bathis is a natural born teacher. He doesn't discriminate and helps everyone regardless of their race.<br><br>
Before I left he asked to send other Sylphs his way if anyone else decided to explore the world. He said he would help them.<br><br>
That is a long and dangerous journey, though. You need to prepare really well if you decide to undertake it.<br>
