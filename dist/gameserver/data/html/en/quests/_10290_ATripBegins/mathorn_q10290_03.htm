Before you only showed as much Death Knight power 
as was necessary for the training. Now it's time to 
show that we're not rookies here<br><br>
First press <font color="LEVEL">Tab</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Alt+V</font> to open your <font color="LEVEL">Inventory</font>.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Equip the weapons and armor</font> you need if you haven't done it already.<br>
You can open the <font color="LEVEL">Skill List</font> by pressing <font color="LEVEL">Alt + K</font>. If you 
changed class, you will see new skills that you can learn here as well. <font color="LEVEL">To learn skills you need to spend 
a specific amount of SP</font>. Sometimes you will also need 
<font color="LEVEL">Spellbooks</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Amulets</font>.<br>
I would also suggest you get the hang of <font color="LEVEL">Automatic 
Hunting</font>. If you know what it is and how it works, 
however, you can skip this part.<br><br>
