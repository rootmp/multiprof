Hm... You are a Sylph, aren't you?<br><br>
Nice to meet you! Since I heard that Sylphs had come to the continent, I've been wishing to meet one of them. Now my dream becomes true!<br><br>
I've heard Gatekeeper Mellos was sent to the Wind Village, but it seems you haven't met her.<br><br>
Well, you should learn to find suitable places to train then.<br><br>
