If you want to experience the full spectrum of Death 
Knight might, you need to continue training.<br><br>
When you <font color="LEVEL">change class</font> you will receive abilities that 
will help you become a worthy Death Knight. Don't 
forget to change class.<br><br>
I think you know enough about changing class now. 
If you want to make further progress, go to Gludio 
and talk to Captain Bathis.<br><br>
Bathis is quite popular around here, it might be 
useful to make friends with him.<br><br>
Also, don't go to the town immediately, first show off 
you Death Knight skills and gain a reputation.<br>
