So, listen carefully.<br><br>
First I'll tell you about hair accessories.<br><br>
Hair accessories change your appearance. To 
enchant a hair accessory you need special 
enchanting scrolls.<br><br>
They say, seeing once is better than hearing twice. 
So I've prepared <font color="LEVEL">Adventurer's Sheep Hat</font> and 
<font color="LEVEL">Adventurer's Scroll: Enchant Hair Accessory</font> for you. 
Use them and enchant equipment. It's easy.<br><br>
Speak me again when you've finished.
