So, let's talk about belts.<br><br>
Belts don't change your appearance, but they are 
important part of your equipment.<br><br>
The most of belts enlarge your inventory or increase 
weight limit.<br><br>
To enchant a belt you need special enchanting 
scrolls. I have one for you, so try to enchant your belt.
