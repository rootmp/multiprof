Good. I'm glad that I could help you at early stages. 
Of course, that's the will of Einhasad and our lord, 
but I'm happy too.<br><br>
By the way, I almost forgot! According to the latest 
Aden King edict I'm supposed to give young 
adventurers pendants. Here you go, I hope you'll find 
a good use for it.<br><br>
And one more thing that you should know. There is a 
new special shop on the continent where you can buy 
amazing items for <font color="LEVEL">L-Coins</font>. I hope you'll find this 
information useful.
