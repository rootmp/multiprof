<html><body>Head Trainer Kilremange:<br><br>
The world has changed a lot. Now we can 
automatically look for and fight enemies. I'm talking 
about a new function called <font color="LEVEL">Automatic Hunting</font>. I 
suggest you master it.<br><br>
When <font color="LEVEL">Automatic Hunting</font> is on, you will easily find 
enemies and attack them. I recommend to use 
<font color="LEVEL">Automatic Hunting</font> to defeat <font color="LEVEL">Skeleton Archers and 
Skeleton Warriors</font> that inhabit the <font color="LEVEL">first training 
grounds</font>.<br>
It's not far from here but I can teleport you there if 
you don't want to waste time.<br>
