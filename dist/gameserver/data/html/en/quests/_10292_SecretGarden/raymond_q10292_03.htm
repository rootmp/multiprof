The garden was a peaceful and nice place before 
mysterious and dreadful beasts invaded it. There's a 
rumour that they have turned all garden animals into 
stone!<br><br>
Now there are no living creatures but Harpies, 
Medusas and Bugbears.<br><br>
World goes around that many strange things have 
been happening in the garden lately. That worries me 
a lot, so I'm looking for a brave soul who would go 
there and find out the truth.<br>
