Go to the Gorgon Flower Garden and explore it 
carefully. I'm sure you'll find there someting 
suspicious. Also kill <font color="LEVEL">Harpies, Medusas, Turak 
Bugbears, Turak Bugbear Warriors and Amber 
Basilisks</font>.<br><br>
The easiest way to reach the Gorgon Flower Garden 
is a teleport that can be found on the teleport page of 
Giran.<br><br>
The mission is very dangerous but I've heard about 
your power, so I've no doubt that you will do what 
should be done. May Einhasad bless you.
