Elder Lukenir:<br>
You did a good job while you were learning the basics of the game. Now you can go on a journey. I want to give you something. Do you know how to use it?<br>
Now go to <font color="LEVEL">Town of Kamael</font> And find <font color="LEVEL">Newbie Guide</font>. He'll give you advice. And also - useful items that will be useful in travel.<br>
You'll find the Newbie Guide by clicking <font color="LEVEL">question mark</font> right at the bottom of the screen and following the pointer. Well, it's time to go. Good luck!
