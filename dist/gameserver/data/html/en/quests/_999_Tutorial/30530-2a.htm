Did you forget about the task? Quickly look for Blue Gemstone. <font color="LEVEL">To get a gem, you need to win Gremlins.</font> <br>
Attack the Gremlin's, as I recently explained to you. Hover over the Gremlin and press the <font color="FF0000">left button</font>. The cursor changes to a sword. With the change of the cursor click the left mouse button and attack.<img src="L2UI_CH3.tutorial_img12" width=64 height=64><br>
When you're done with it, I'll give you something useful as a gift. So, good luck.<br>
