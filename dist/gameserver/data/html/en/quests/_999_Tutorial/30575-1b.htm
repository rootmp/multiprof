Hello! Now I'll give you a task. See Gremlin's around? They stole a precious Blue Gemstone.<br>
Your task - to bring him back. You must destroy the <font color="LEVEL">Gremlin's</font>.<br>
To attack a monster, hover over it and click the <font color="FF0000">left mouse button</font>. The cursor will turn into a sword. In this state, you must re-press the left mouse button, and you will begin to attack.<img src="L2UI_CH3.tutorial_img12" width=64 height=64><br>
Try using <font color="LEVEL">"Soul Cry"</font> before the attack. You will see that level of attack will increase. Use this skill, you can use the <font color="FF0000">key F2</font>, and when it is pressed again "Soul Cry" is disabled.<table border=0><tr><td><img src="L2UI_CH3.tutorial_img133" width=64 height=64></td><td><img src="L2UI_CH3.tutorial_img17" width=64 height=64></td></tr></table><br>
