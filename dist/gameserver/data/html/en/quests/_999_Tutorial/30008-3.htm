Grand Master Roien:<br>
You worked hard, yet taught the basics of the game. Now you can go on a trip. I want to give you something. You probably already know how to use it?<br>
Now go to <font color="LEVEL">Talking Island Village</font> and find the <font color="LEVEL">Newbie Guide</font>. He will give you advice. And yet - useful items that will be useful when traveling.<br>
You'll find the Newbie Guide, by clicking the <font color="LEVEL">question mark</font> at the bottom right of the screen and follow the pointer. Well, time to go. Good luck!
