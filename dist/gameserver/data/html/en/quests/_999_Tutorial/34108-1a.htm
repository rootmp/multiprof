Newbie Helper:<br>
Welcome. I want to give you one assignment. Have you met the Gremlins in the neighborhood? These bastards stole the precious Blue Gem and escaped.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Your job is to find him. To return the gem, you need to hunt gremlins.</font><br>
Hover over Gremlin and click <font color="FF0000">left button</font>. The cursor will take the form of a sword. With the cursor changed, click again with the left button and attack.<img src="L2UI_CH3.tutorial_img12" width=64 height=64><br>
When you're done with this, I'll give you something useful as a gift. So, good luck.<br>
