<html><body>Judge's Sepulcher Manager:<br>
Only <font color="LEVEL">a party of 4 characters of Lv. 80 and above</font> can enter the Four Sepulchers, where the emperors of Elmoreden lay. Also you need a Grave Pass.<br>
The Sepulchers had become unstable because of Frtintezza, and when the Halisha's Shadow appeared the things turned to worse. To enter the Unstable Sepulcher each character must have <font color="LEVEL">3 Grave Passes</font>. Dangerous monsters dwell there, so not everyone is allowed to enter.<br>
