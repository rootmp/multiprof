Warehouse Keeper Balcon:<br>
Welcome, friend! I guess people are making money these days -- more and more people are storing their goods with us! If it continues like this, I'll be the branch manager of this Guild in no time!<br>
Once you store your goods, you can withdraw them anywhere! Well, the designated person has to come, of course.<br>
