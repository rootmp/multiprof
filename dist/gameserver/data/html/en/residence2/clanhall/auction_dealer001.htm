<br>Ah, so you've come to see the clan hall!<br>
Good idea! A clan hall is something that every clan should have, don't you agree?<br>
There is a <font color="FFFB99">Clan Hall</font>, which can be purchased at the auction and <font color="FFFB99">Resupply Hall</font>, which can be obtained by winning the auction.<br>
There are many wonderful things here, so take your time!
