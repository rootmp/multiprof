Trader Rex:
<br>
Welcome! Welcome to the Ivory Tower!<br>
This place is known as a sanctuary magicians, but there is not only sorcerers. This can come each. I myself was once a paladin in the service of Einhasad. But I did not betray the oath!<br>
As you know, strange things often happen in this tower. Do not go there, where you should not, even if you will be very interesting. It may be dangerous.<br>
