Trader Sabrin:<br>
Here in Dion, people are still uneasy after that farmers' revolt a few years ago. Don't rely on the authorities to keep you safe -- look after yourself! You've come to the right store, friend. We carry only the best weapons and armor. Look around and let me know if you see anything you like!<br>
