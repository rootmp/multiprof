Welcome! Our shop is filled with history and tradition. We pride ourselves on carrying many rare weapons you won't see elsewhere, from axes handcrafted by famous Dwarven artisans to elegant Mithril weapons that possess the mysterious power of the Elves. Take your time and let me know if you see anything you like. By the way, you should know that there are several <font color="LEVEL">ferocious monsters</font> around here -- don't leave this village without being properly prepared!<br>
