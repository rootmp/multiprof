	 * converting: Skill 1229 is in hex 4CD, but in packet it is CD 04 00 00. So i
	 * think that we must read the skill's hex id form behind ^^ 2). multipe skills
	 * on row 2: i don't know what more skills can go at row2 @ offie. please
	 * contact me to test it. Currently packet is working for one skill. 3).
	 * Removing buff icon must be sended empty packet F4 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
	 * 00 00 00 to remove buff icon. Or it will be lasted forever.
